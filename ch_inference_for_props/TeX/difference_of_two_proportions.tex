\eoce{\qt{Social experiment, Part I\label{social_experiment_conditions}} A ``social 
experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do when they see 
a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her boyfriend. On two 
different occasions at the same restaurant, the same couple was depicted. In 
one scenario the woman was dressed ``provocatively'' and in the other 
scenario the woman was dressed ``conservatively''. The table below shows how 
many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and whether or not 
they intervened.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll cc c} 
            &               & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Scenario}} \\

Explain why the sampling distribution of the difference between the 
proportions of interventions under provocative and conservative scenarios 
does not follow an approximately normal distribution.

\eoce{\qt{Heart transplant success\label{heart_transplant_conditions}} The Stanford 
University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an 
experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient 
entering the program was officially designated a heart transplant candidate, 
meaning that he was gravely ill and might benefit from a new heart. Patients 
were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups. Patients in the 
treatment group received a transplant, and those in the control group did 
not. The table below displays how many patients survived and died in each 
group. \footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcc}
\hline
            & control   & treatment \\

\end{center}
Suppose we are interested in estimating the difference in survival rate between 
the control and treatment groups using a confidence interval.
Explain why we cannot construct such an interval using the normal 
approximation. What might go wrong if we constructed the confidence interval 
despite this problem?

\eoce{\qt{Gender and color preference\label{gender_color_preference_CI_concept}} 
A study asked 1,924 male and 3,666 female undergraduate college students 
their favorite color.
A 95\% confidence interval for the difference between 
the proportions of males and females whose favorite color is black 
$(p_{male} - p_{female})$ was calculated to be (0.02, 0.06).
Based on this 
information, determine if the following statements about
undergraduate college students are true or false, and 
explain your reasoning for each statement you identify as false.
\footfullcite{Ellis:2001}
\begin{parts}
\item We are 95\% confident that the true proportion of males whose favorite 
color is black is 2\% lower to 6\% higher than the true proportion of females 
whose favorite color is black.
\item We are 95\% confident that the true proportion of males whose favorite 
color is black is 2\% to 6\% higher than the true proportion of females whose 
favorite color is black.
\item 95\% of random samples will produce 95\% confidence intervals that 
include the true difference between the population proportions of males and 
females whose favorite color is black.
\item We can conclude that there is a significant difference between the 
proportions of males and females whose favorite color is black and that the 
difference between the two sample proportions is too large to plausibly be 
due to chance.
\item The 95\% confidence interval for $(p_{female} - p_{male})$ cannot be 
calculated with only the information given in this exercise.

\eoce{\qt{Government shutdown\label{government_shutdown_CI_concept}}
The United States federal government shutdown of 2018â€“2019 occurred
from December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, a span of 35 days.
A~Survey USA poll of 614 randomly sampled Americans during this time
period reported that 48\% of those who make less than \$40,000 per
year and 55\% of those who make \$40,000 or more per year said the
government shutdown has not at all affected them personally.
A~95\% confidence interval for $(p_\text{$<$40K} - p_\text{$\ge$40K})$,
where $p$ is the proportion of those who said the government shutdown
has not at all affected them personally, is (-0.16, 0.02).
Based on this information, determine if the following statements are 
true or false, and explain your reasoning if you identify the statement
as false.\footfullcite{data:govt_shuthown}
\begin{parts}
\item
    At the 5\% significance level, the data provide convincing
    evidence of a real difference in the proportion who are
    not affected personally between Americans who make less than
    \$40,000 annually and Americans who make \$40,000 annually.
\item
    We are 95\% confident that 16\% more to 2\% fewer Americans
    who make less than \$40,000 per year are not at all personally
    affected by the government shutdown compared to those who make
    \$40,000 or more per year.
\item
    A 90\% confidence interval for
    $(p_\text{$<$40K} - p_\text{$\ge$40K})$
    would be wider than the $(-0.16, 0.02)$ interval.
\item
    A 95\% confidence interval for
    $(p_\text{$\ge$40K} - p_\text{$<$40K})$
    is (-0.02, 0.16).

    Part III\label{national_health_plan_CI_replaced}}
Exercise~\ref{national_health_plan_HT}
presents the results of a poll evaluating support for
a generically branded ``National Health Plan''
in the United States.
79\% of 347 Democrats and 55\% of 617 Independents
support a National Health Plan.
\begin{parts}
\item
    Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the
    difference between the proportion of Democrats
    and Independents who support a National
    Health Plan $(p_{D} - p_{I})$, and interpret
    it in this context.
    We have already checked conditions for you.
\item
    True or false:
    If we had picked a random Democrat and a random
    Independent at the time of this poll, it is more
    likely that the Democrat would support the National
    Health Plan than the Independent.

\eoce{\qt{Sleep deprivation, CA vs. OR, Part II\label{sleep_OR_CA_HT}} 
Exercise~\ref{sleep_OR_CA_CI} provides data on sleep deprivation rates of 
Californians and Oregonians. The proportion of California residents who 
reported insufficient rest or sleep during each of the preceding 30 days is 
8.0\%, while this proportion is 8.8\% for Oregon residents. These data are 
based on simple random samples of 11,545 California and 4,691 Oregon 
residents.

\eoce{\qt{Full body scan, Part I\label{full_body_scan_HT_Error}} A news article 
reports that ``Americans have differing views on two potentially inconvenient 
and invasive practices that airports could implement to uncover potential 
terrorist attacks." This news piece was based on a survey conducted among a 
random sample of 1,137 adults nationwide, where one of the questions on the 
survey was ``Some airports are 
now using `full-body' digital x-ray machines to electronically screen

\eoce{\qt{HIV in sub-Saharan Africa\label{hiv_africa_HT}}
In July 2008 the US National Institutes of Health announced
that it was stopping a clinical study early because of unexpected
results.
The study population consisted of HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan
Africa who had been given single dose Nevaripine (a treatment for HIV)
while giving birth, to prevent transmission of HIV to the infant.
The study was a randomized comparison of continued
treatment of a woman (after successful childbirth)
with Nevaripine vs Lopinavir, a second drug used to treat HIV.
240 women participated in the study;
120 were randomized to each of the two treatments.
Twenty-four weeks after starting the study treatment,
each woman was tested to determine if the HIV infection
was becoming worse (an outcome called \textit{virologic failure}).
Twenty-six of the 120 women treated with Nevaripine experienced
virologic failure, while 10 of the 120 women treated with the
other drug experienced virologic failure.\footfullcite{Lockman:2007}

rates between treatment groups.
