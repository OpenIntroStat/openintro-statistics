\eoce{\qt{Migraine and acupuncture\label{migraine_and_acupuncture_intro}} A migraine 
is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to 
treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine 
pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females 
diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 
treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture 
that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control 
group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint 
locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked 
if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below.

Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis 
compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed 
with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. Study 
participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) 
or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of 
symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the 
end of the 10-day period patients were asked if they experienced significant 
improvement in symptoms. The distribution of responses are summarized below.

\eoce{\qt{Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components\label{study_components_airpoll}} 
Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants 
and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels 
were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon 
monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts 
per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\mu g/m^3$. 
Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 
and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each 
birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser 
degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.

\eoce{\qt{Buteyko method, study components\label{study_components_buteyko}} 
The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin 
Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko 
method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific 
study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 
asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These 
patients were split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method 
and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, 
asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, 
the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in 
asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. \footfullcite{McDowan:2003}.

Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and 
self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 
15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child 
or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and 
to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they they 
would only reward children who report white. Half the students were explicitly 
told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. In 
the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform 
across groups based on child's characteristics. In the group that was 
explicitly told to not cheat, girls were less likely to cheat, and while rate 
of cheating didn't vary by age for boys, it decreased with age for girls.

individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children
in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. After 
completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies 
they had taken. It was found that those who were identified as upper-class

participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, 
when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25\% of the group had 
dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer's disease and 416 with vascular 
dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that 
pack-a-day smokers were 37\% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, 
and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44\% for one to two packs a day; 
and twice the risk for more than two packs."}

{\footnotesize ``The University of Michigan study, collected survey data from 
parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to 
assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were 
identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior 
or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and 
those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown 
symptoms of sleep disorders."}

individuals in online interactions, researchers hypothesized that shy 
individuals might have more favorable attitudes toward Facebook, and that 
shyness might be positively correlated with time spent on Facebook. They also 
hypothesized that shy individuals might have fewer Facebook ``friends" as they 
tend to have fewer friends than non-shy individuals have in the offline world. 
103 undergraduate students at an Ontario university were surveyed via online 
questionnaires. The study states ``Participants were recruited through the

\eoce{\qt{Side effects of Avandia\label{randomization_avandia}} Rosiglitazone is the 
active ingredient in the controversial type~2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has 
been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as 
stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, 
the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. In a nationwide 
retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged  
65 years or older, it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using 
rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious 
cardiovascular problems. These data are summarized in the contingency 
table below. \footfullcite{Graham:2010}

\item Determine if each of the following statements is true or false. If false, explain why. \textit{Be careful:} The reasoning may be wrong even if the statement's conclusion is correct. In such cases, the statement should be considered false.
\begin{subparts}
\item Since more patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems (5,386 vs. 2,593), we can conclude that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a pioglitazone treatment is higher.
\item The data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8\% for patients on this treatment, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4\% for patients on pioglitazone.
\item The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.
\item Based on the information provided so far, we cannot tell if the difference between the rates of incidences is due to a relationship between the two variables or due to chance.

\item What proportion of all patients had cardiovascular problems?
\item If the type of treatment and having cardiovascular problems were independent, about how many patients in the rosiglitazone group would we expect to have had cardiovascular problems?
\item We can investigate the relationship between outcome and treatment in this study using a randomization technique.  While in reality we would carry out the simulations required for randomization using statistical software, suppose we actually simulate using index cards. In order to simulate from the independence model, which states that the outcomes were independent of the treatment, we write whether or not each patient had a cardiovascular problem on cards, shuffled all the cards together, then deal them into two groups of size 67,593 and 159,978. We repeat this simulation 1,000 times and each time record the number of people in the rosiglitazone group who had cardiovascular problems. Use the relative frequency histogram of these counts to answer (i)-(iii).

\eoce{\qt{Heart transplants\label{randomization_heart_transplants}} The Stanford 
University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an 
experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient 
entering the program was designated an official heart transplant candidate, 
meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. 
Some patients got a transplant and some did not. The variable \texttt{transplant} 
indicates which group the patients were in; patients in the treatment group got a 
transplant and those in the control group did not. Another variable called 
\texttt{survived} was used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive 
at the end of the study. \footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}

\item Based on the mosaic plot, is survival independent of whether or not the 
patient got a transplant? Explain your reasoning.
\item What do the box plots below suggest about the efficacy (effectiveness) of the heart transplant treatment.
\item What proportion of patients in the treatment group and what proportion of 
patients in the control group died?
\item One approach for investigating whether or not the treatment is effective 
is to use a randomization technique.
\begin{subparts}
\item What are the claims being tested?
\item The paragraph below describes the set up for such approach, if we were 
to do it without using statistical software. Fill in the blanks with a number 
or phrase, whichever is appropriate.
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
We write \textit{alive} on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were 
alive at the end of the study, and \textit{dead} on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards 
representing patients who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them 
into two groups: one group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing treatment, and 
another group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing control. We calculate the 
difference between the proportion of \textit{dead} cards in the treatment and 
control groups (treatment - control) and record this value. We repeat this 100 
times to build a distribution centered at \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. Lastly, we calculate 
the fraction of simulations where the simulated differences in proportions are 
\rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. If this fraction is low, we conclude that it is unlikely to 
have observed such an outcome by chance and that the null hypothesis should 
be rejected in favor of the alternative.

of the transplant program?
