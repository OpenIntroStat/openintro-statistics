\qt{Pet names\label{seattle_pet_names}}
The city of Seattle, WA has an open data portal that
includes pets registered in the city.
For each registered pet,
we have information on the pet's name and species.
The following visualization plots the proportion of dogs
with a given name versus the proportion of cats with the
same name.
The 20 most common cat and dog names are displayed.
The diagonal line on the plot is the $x = y$ line;
if a name appeared on this line, the name's popularity
would be exactly the same for dogs and cats.

\eoce{\qt{Chia seeds and weight loss\label{chia_weight_lostt}} Chia Pets -- those terra-cotta 
figurines that sprout fuzzy green hair -- made the chia plant a household name. But chia 
has gained an entirely new reputation as a diet supplement.  In one 2009 study, a team 
of researchers recruited 38 men and divided them randomly into two groups: treatment or 
control. They also recruited 38 women, and they randomly placed half of these 
participants into the treatment group and the other half into the control group. One 
group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, and the other was given a placebo. 
The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12 weeks, the scientists found 
no significant difference between the groups in appetite or weight loss.

\eoce{\qt{City council survey\label{city_council_survey}}
A city council has requested a household survey be conducted
in a suburban area of their city.
The area is broken into many distinct and unique neighborhoods,
some including large homes, some with only apartments, and others
a diverse mixture of housing structures.
For each part below,
identify the sampling methods described,
and describe the statistical pros and cons of the method
in the city's context.
\begin{parts}
\item
    Randomly sample 200 households from the city.
\item
    Divide the city into 20 neighborhoods,
    and sample 10 households from each neighborhood.
\item
    Divide the city into 20 neighborhoods,
    randomly sample 3 neighborhoods,
    and then sample all households from those 3 neighborhoods.
\item
    Divide the city into 20 neighborhoods,
    randomly sample 8 neighborhoods,

    from those neighborhoods.
\item
    Sample the 200 households closest to the city council offices.

\eoce{\qt{Flawed reasoning\label{flawed_reasoning}} Identify the flaw(s) in reasoning 
in the following scenarios. Explain what the individuals in the study should 
have done differently if they wanted to make such strong conclusions.
\begin{parts}
\item Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they 
are asked to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions 
asked is, ``Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to 
spend time with your kids after school?" Of the parents who replied, 85\% said 
``no". Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great 
majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids 
after school.
\item A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who 
recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during 
pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems 
is conducted 3 years later.
However, only 567 of these women are reached at the 
same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women are representative 
of all mothers.
\item An orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients who do 
not have any joint problems and finds that 20 of them regularly go running. 
He concludes that running decreases the risk of joint problems.

\eoce{\qt[?]{Eat better, feel better\label{eat_better_feel_better}}
In a public health 
study on the effects of consumption of fruits and vegetables on psychological 
well-being in young adults, participants were randomly assigned to three 
groups: (1) diet-as-usual, (2) an ecological momentary intervention involving 
text message reminders to increase their fruits and vegetable consumption plus 
a voucher to purchase them, or (3) a fruit and vegetable intervention in 
which participants were given two additional daily servings of fresh fruits and 
vegetables to consume on top of their normal diet. Participants were asked to 
take a nightly survey on their smartphones.
Participants were student volunteers at the University of 
Otago, New Zealand.
At the end of the 14-day study, only participants in the third
group showed improvements to their psychological well-being across
the 14-days relative to the other groups.\footfullcite{conner2017let}

    Comment on whether the results of the study can be used to establish

\item
    A newspaper article reporting on the study states,
    ``The results of this study provide proof that giving young adults
    fresh fruits and vegetables to eat can have psychological benefits,
    even over a brief period of time.''
    How would you suggest revising this statement so that it can be
    supported by the study?

\eoce{\qt{Screens, teens, and psychological well-being\label{screen_time_well_being}}
In a study of three nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, 
the United States, and the United Kingdom (n = 17,247), teenagers between the 
ages of 12 to 15 were asked to keep a diary of their screen time and answer questions about how they felt or acted.
The answers to these questions 
were then used to compute a psychological well-being score.
Additional data were collected and included in the analysis,
such as each child's sex and age, and on the motherâ€™s education,
ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment.
The study concluded that there is little clear-cut evidence
that screen time decreases adolescent
well-being.\footfullcite{orben2018screens}
