\eoce{\qt{Identify hypotheses, Part I\label{
}}
Write the null and alternative hypotheses in words and then symbols
for each of the following  situations.
\begin{parts}
\item
    A tutoring company would like to understand if most
    students tend to improve their grades (or not) after
    they use their services.
    They sample 200 of the students who used their service
    in the past year and ask them if their grades have
    improved or declined from the previous year.
\item
    Employers at a firm are worried about the effect of March Madness,
    a basketball championship held each spring in the US, on employee
    productivity.
    They estimate that on a regular business day employees spend on
    average 15 minutes of company time checking personal email,
    making personal phone calls, etc.
    They also collect data on how much company time employees spend
    on such non-business activities during March Madness.
    They want to determine if these data provide convincing evidence
    that employee productivity changed during March Madness.

\eoce{\qt{Identify hypotheses, Part II\label{identify_hypotheses_prop_and_mean_2}} 
Write the null and alternative hypotheses in words and using symbols 
for each of the following situations.
\begin{parts}
\item
    Since 2008, chain restaurants in California have been required
    to display calorie counts of each menu item. Prior to menus
    displaying calorie counts, the average calorie intake of diners
    at a restaurant was 1100 calories.
    After calorie counts started to be displayed on menus,
    a nutritionist collected data on the number of calories consumed
    at this restaurant from a random sample of diners.
    Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference in the
    average calorie intake of a diners at this restaurant?
\item
    The state of Wisconsin would like to understand
    the fraction of its adult residents that consumed alcohol
    in the last year,
    specifically if the rate is different from the
    national rate of 70\%.
    To help them answer this question, they conduct
    a random sample of 852 residents and ask them
    about their alcohol consumption.

\eoce{\qt{Online communication\label{online_communication_prop_ht_errors}}

10~or more hours per week communicating with others online.
You believe that this is incorrect and decide to collect your 
own sample for a hypothesis test.
You randomly sample 160 students from your dorm
and find that 70\% spent 10~or more hours a week
communicating with others online.
A~friend of yours, who offers to help you with
the hypothesis test, comes up with the following
set of hypotheses.
Indicate any errors you see.
\begin{align*}
H_0&: \hat{p} < 0.6 \\
H_A&: \hat{p} > 0.7

\eoce{\qt{Married at 25\label{married_at_25_prop_ht_errors}}
A study suggests that the 25\% of 25 year olds have
gotten married.
You believe that this is incorrect and decide to collect
your own sample for a hypothesis test.
From a random sample of 25 year olds in census data
with size 776,
you find that 24\% of them are married.
A friend of yours offers to help you with setting
up the hypothesis test and comes up with the following
hypotheses.
Indicate any errors you see.
\begin{align*}
H_0&: \hat{p} = 0.24 \\
H_A&: \hat{p} \neq 0.24

\eoce{\qt{Cyberbullying rates\label{cyberbullying_prop_ci_ht}}
Teens were surveyed about cyberbullying, and
54\% to 64\% reported experiencing cyberbullying
(95\% confidence interval).\footfullcite{pew_cyber_bully_2018}
Answer the following questions based on this interval.
\begin{parts}
\item 
    A newspaper claims that a majority of teens
    have experienced cyberbullying.
    Is this claim supported by the confidence interval?
    Explain your reasoning.
\item\label{cyberbullying_prop_ci_ht_researcher}
    A researcher conjectured that 70\% of teens have
    experienced cyberbullying.
    Is this claim supported by the confidence interval?
    Explain your reasoning.
\item
    Without actually calculating the interval, determine
    if the claim of the researcher from
    part~(\ref{cyberbullying_prop_ci_ht_researcher})
    would be supported based on a 90\% confidence interval?

\eoce{\qt{Waiting at an ER, Part II\label{er_wait_ci_ht_prop_ok}}
Exercise~\ref{er_wait_intro_prop_ok} 
provides a 95\% confidence interval for the mean waiting
time at an emergency room (ER) of (128 minutes, 147 minutes).
Answer the following questions based on this interval.
\begin{parts}
\item
    A local newspaper claims that the average waiting time
    at this ER exceeds 3 hours.
    Is this claim supported by the confidence interval?
    Explain your reasoning.
\item\label{er_wait_ci_ht_prop_ok_dean}
    The Dean of Medicine at this hospital claims the
    average wait time is 2.2 hours.
    Is this claim supported by the confidence interval?
    Explain your reasoning.
\item
    Without actually calculating the interval,
    determine if the claim of the Dean from
    part~(\ref{er_wait_ci_ht_prop_ok_dean})
    would be supported based on a 99\% confidence interval?

\eoce{\qt{Minimum wage, Part I\label{minimum_wage_prop_1}}
Do a majority of US adults believe raising
the minimum wage will help the economy,
or is there a majority who do not believe this?
A~Rasmussen Reports survey of a random sample of 1,000 US adults found
that 42\% believe it will help the
economy.\footfullcite{webpage:rasmussen-2019-raise-minimum-wage}
Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test to help
answer the research question.

\eoce{\qt{Getting enough sleep\label{univ_students_enough_sleep}}
400 students were randomly sampled from a large university,
and 289 said they did not get enough sleep.

represents a statistically significant difference
from 50\%, and use a significance level of 0.01.

\eoce{\qt{Testing for Fibromyalgia\label{errors_fibromyalgia}} A patient named Diana 
was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term syndrome of body pain, and was 
prescribed anti-depressants. Being the skeptic that she is, Diana didn't 
initially believe that anti-depressants would help her symptoms. However after 
a couple months of being on the medication she decides that the 
anti-depressants are working, because she feels like her symptoms are in fact 
getting better.
\begin{parts}
\item Write the hypotheses in words for Diana's skeptical position when she 
started taking the anti-depressants.
\item What is a Type~1 Error in this context?
\item What is a Type~2 Error in this context?

\eoce{\qtq{Which is higher\label{prop_which_higher_found_inf}}
In each part below, there is a value of interest and two
scenarios (I and II).
For each part, report if the value of interest is larger
under scenario I, scenario II, or whether the value is
equal under the scenarios.
\begin{parts}
\item
     The standard error of $\hat{p}$ when
     (I)~$n = 125$ or (II)~$n = 500$.
\item
    The margin of error of a confidence interval
    when the confidence level is
    (I)~90\% or (II)~80\%.
\item
    The p-value for a Z-statistic of 2.5 calculated
    based on a (I)~sample with $n = 500$ or based on
    a (II)~sample with $n = 1000$.
\item
    The probability of making a Type~2 Error when the
    alternative hypothesis is true and the significance
