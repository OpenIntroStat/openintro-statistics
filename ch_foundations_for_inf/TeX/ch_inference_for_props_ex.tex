\eoce{\qt{Vegetarian college students\label{veg_coll_students_CLT}} Suppose that 
8\% of college students are vegetarians. Determine if the following statements 
are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item The distribution of the sample proportions of vegetarians in random samples 
of size 60 is approximately normal since $n \ge 30$. 
\item The distribution of the sample proportions of vegetarian college students 
in random samples of size 50 is right skewed.
\item A random sample of 125 college students where 12\% are vegetarians would 
be considered unusual. 
\item A random sample of 250 college students where 12\% are vegetarians would 
be considered unusual.
\item The standard error would be reduced by one-half if we increased the 
sample size from 125 to~250.

\eoce{\qt{Young Americans, Part I\label{young_americans_CLT_1}} About 77\% of 
young adults think they can achieve the American dream. Determine if the 
following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
\footfullcite{news:youngAmericans1}
\begin{parts}
\item The distribution of sample proportions of young Americans who think they 
can achieve the American dream in samples of size 20 is left skewed.
\item The distribution of sample proportions of young Americans who think they 
can achieve the American dream in random samples of size 40 is approximately 
normal since $n \ge 30$. 
\item A random sample of 60 young Americans where 85\% think they can achieve 
the American dream would be considered unusual.
\item A random sample of 120 young Americans where 85\% think they can achieve 
the American dream would be considered unusual.

\eoce{\qt{Orange tabbies\label{orange_tabbies_CLT}} Suppose that 90\% of orange 
tabby cats are male. Determine if the following statements are true or false, 
and explain your reasoning.
\begin{parts}
\item The distribution of sample proportions of random samples of size 30 is 
left skewed.
\item Using a sample size that is 4 times as large will reduce the standard 
error of the sample proportion by one-half.
\item The distribution of sample proportions of random samples of size 140 is 
approximately normal.
\item The distribution of sample proportions of random samples of size 280 is 
approximately normal.

% 4

\eoce{\qt{Young Americans, Part II\label{young_americans_CLT_2}} About 25\% of 
young Americans have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic 
slump. Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain 
your reasoning.\footfullcite{news:youngAmericans2}
\begin{parts}
\item The distribution of sample proportions of young Americans who have 
delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump in random samples 
of size 12 is right skewed.
\item In order for the distribution of sample proportions of young Americans 
who have delayed starting a family due to the continued economic slump to be 
approximately normal, we need random samples where the sample size is at least 
40.
\item A random sample of 50 young Americans where 20\% have delayed starting 
a family due to the continued economic slump would be considered unusual.
\item A random sample of 150 young Americans where 20\% have delayed starting 
a family due to the continued economic slump would be considered unusual.
\item Tripling the sample size will reduce the standard error of the sample 
proportion by one-third.

\eoce{\qt{Prop 19 in California\label{prop_19_CI_concept}} In a 2010 Survey 
USA poll, 70\% of the 119 respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 said they 
would vote in the 2010 general election for Prop 19, which would change 
California law to legalize marijuana and allow it to be regulated and taxed. 
At a 95\% confidence level, this sample has an 8\% margin of error. Based on 
this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, 
and explain your reasoning.\footfullcite{data:prop19_and_offshoreDrill}
\begin{parts}
\item We are 95\% confident that between 62\% and 78\% of the California voters 
in this sample support Prop 19.
\item We are 95\% confident that between 62\% and 78\% of all California voters 
between the ages of 18 and 34 support Prop 19.
\item If we considered many random samples of 119 California voters between the 
ages of 18 and 34, and we calculated 95\% confidence intervals for each, 95\% of 
them will include the true population proportion of 18-34 year old Californians 
who support Prop 19.
\item In order to decrease the margin of error to 4\%, we would need to 
quadruple (multiply by 4) the sample size.
\item Based on this confidence interval, there is sufficient evidence to conclude 
that a majority of California voters between the ages of 18 and 34 support Prop 19.

\eoce{\qt{2010 Healthcare Law\label{healthcare_CI_concept}} On June 28, 2012 the 
U.S. Supreme Court upheld the much debated 2010 healthcare law, declaring it 
constitutional. A Gallup poll released the day after this decision indicates that 
46\% of 1,012 Americans agree with this decision. At a 95\% confidence level, 
this sample has a 3\% margin of error. Based on this information, determine if 
the following statements are true or false, and explain your 
reasoning.\footfullcite{data:healthcare2010}
\begin{parts}
\item We are 95\% confident that between 43\% and 49\% of Americans in this 
sample support the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on the 2010 healthcare law.
\item We are 95\% confident that between 43\% and 49\% of Americans support the 
decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on the 2010 healthcare law.
\item If we considered many random samples of 1,012 Americans, and we calculated 
the sample proportions of those who support the decision of the U.S. Supreme 
Court, 95\% of those sample proportions will be between 43\% and 49\%.
\item The margin of error at a 90\% confidence level would be higher than 3\%.

\eoce{\qt{Fireworks on July $4^{\text{th}}$\label{fireworks_CI_concept}} In late 
June 2012, Survey USA published results of a survey stating that 56\% of the 
600 randomly sampled Kansas residents planned to set off fireworks on 
July~$4^{th}$. Determine the margin of error for the 56\% point estimate using a 
95\% confidence level.\footfullcite{data:july4}

\eoce{\qt{Elderly drivers\label{elderly_drivers_CI_concept}} In January 2011, 
The Marist Poll published a report stating that 66\% of adults nationally think 
licensed drivers should be required to retake their road test once they reach 
65 years of age. It was also reported that interviews were conducted on 1,018 
American adults, and that the margin of error was 3\% using a 95\% confidence 
level. \footfullcite{data:elderlyDriving}
\begin{parts}
\item Verify the margin of error reported by The Marist Poll. 
\item Based on a 95\% confidence interval, does the poll provide convincing 
evidence that \textit{more than} 70\% of the population think that licensed 
drivers should be required to retake their road test once they turn 65?

\eoce{\qt{Life after college\label{life_after_college_CI}} We are interested 
in estimating the proportion of graduates at a mid-sized university who found 
a job within one year of completing their undergraduate degree. Suppose we 
conduct a survey and find out that 348 of the 400 randomly sampled graduates 
found jobs. The graduating class under consideration included over 4500 
students.
\begin{parts}
\item Describe the population parameter of interest. What is the value of the 
point estimate of this parameter?
\item Check if the conditions for constructing a confidence interval based on 
these data are met.
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of graduates who 
found a job within one year of completing their undergraduate degree at this 
university, and interpret it in the context of the data.
\item What does ``95\% confidence" mean?
\item Now calculate a 99\% confidence interval for the same parameter and 
interpret it in the context of the data.
\item Compare the widths of the 95\% and 99\% confidence intervals. Which one 
is wider? Explain.

\eoce{\qt{Life rating in Greece\label{greece_life_rating_CI}} Greece has faced 
a severe economic crisis since the end of 2009. A Gallup poll surveyed 1,000 
randomly sampled Greeks in 2011 and found that 25\% of them said they would rate 
their lives poorly enough to be considered ``suffering''.\footfullcite{data:suffering}
\begin{parts}
\item Describe the population parameter of interest. What is the value of the 
point estimate of this parameter?
\item Check if the conditions required for constructing a confidence interval 
based on these data are met.
\item Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of Greeks who 
are ``suffering".
\item Without doing any calculations, describe what would happen to the confidence 
interval if we decided to use a higher confidence level.

\eoce{\qt{Study abroad\label{study_abroad_CI_decision}} A survey on 1,509 high 
school seniors who took the SAT and who completed an optional web survey between 
April 25 and April 30, 2007 shows that 55\% of high school seniors are fairly 
certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in 
college.\footfullcite{data:studyAbroad}
\begin{parts}
\item Is this sample a representative sample from the population of all high 
school seniors in the US? Explain your reasoning.
\item Let's suppose the conditions for inference are met. Even if your answer 
to part (a) indicated that this approach would not be reliable, this analysis 
may still be interesting to carry out (though not report). Construct a 90\% 
confidence interval for the proportion of high school seniors (of those who took 
the SAT) who are fairly certain they will participate in a study abroad program 
in college, and interpret this interval in context.
\item What does ``90\% confidence" mean?
\item Based on this interval, would it be appropriate to claim that the majority 
of high school seniors are fairly certain that they will participate in a study 
abroad program in college?

\eoce{\qt{Legalization of marijuana, Part I\label{legalize_marijuana_CI_decision}} 
The 2010 General Social Survey asked 1,259 US residents: ``Do you think the use of 
marijuana should be made legal, or not?" 48\% of the respondents said it should be 
made legal.\footfullcite{data:gss:2010}
\begin{parts}
\item Is 48\% a sample statistic or a population parameter? Explain.
\item Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of US residents who 
think marijuana should be made legal, and interpret it in the context of the data.
\item A critic points out that this 95\% confidence interval is only accurate if 
the statistic follows a normal distribution, or if the normal model is a good 
approximation. Is this true for these data? Explain.
\item A news piece on this survey's findings states, ``Majority of Americans think 
marijuana should be legalized.'' Based on your confidence interval, is this news 
piece's statement justified?

\eoce{\qt{Public option, Part I\label{public_option_HT}} A \textit{Washington Post} 
article from 2009 reported that ``support for a government-run health-care plan to 
compete with private insurers has rebounded from its summertime lows and wins clear 
majority support from the public." More specifically, the article says ``seven in 10 
Democrats back the plan, while almost nine in 10 Republicans oppose it. Independents 
divide 52 percent against, 42 percent in favor of the legislation." (6\% responded 
with ``other".) There were 819 Democrats, 566 Republicans and 783 Independents 
surveyed. \footfullcite{news:publicOption}
\begin{parts}
\item A political pundit on TV claims that a majority of Independents oppose the 
health care public option plan. Do these data provide strong evidence to support 
this statement?
\item Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of Independents 
who oppose the public option plan to include 0.5? Explain.

\eoce{\qt{The Civil War\label{civil_war_HT_CI}} A national survey conducted in 2011 
among a simple random sample of 1,507 adults shows that 56\% of Americans think the 
Civil War is still relevant to American politics and political 
life. \footfullcite{data:civilWar} 
\begin{parts}
\item Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence 
that the majority of the Americans think the Civil War is still relevant.
\item Interpret the p-value in this context.
\item Calculate a 90\% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who think 
the Civil War is still relevant. Interpret the interval in this context, and comment 
on whether or not the confidence interval agrees with the conclusion of the 
hypothesis test.

\eoce{\qt{Browsing on the mobile device\label{mobile_browsing_HT_CI}} A 2012 survey 
of 2,254 American adults indicates that 17\% of cell phone owners do their browsing 
on their phone rather than a computer or other device.\footfullcite{data:mobileBrowse}
\begin{parts}
\item According to an online article, a report from a mobile research company 
indicates that 38 percent of Chinese mobile web users only access the internet through 
their cell phones.\footfullcite{news:mobileBrowseChinese} Conduct a hypothesis test to 
determine if these data provide strong evidence that the proportion of Americans who 
only use their cell phones to access the internet is different than the Chinese 
proportion of 38\%.
\item Interpret the p-value in this context.
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who access 
the internet on their cell phones, and interpret the interval in this context.

\eoce{\qt{Is college worth it? Part I\label{college_worth_it_HT_CI}} Among a simple 
random sample of 331 American adults who do not have a four-year college degree and 
are not currently enrolled in school, 48\% said they decided not to go to college 
because they could not afford school. \footfullcite{data:collegeWorthIt}
\begin{parts}
\item A newspaper article states that only a minority of the Americans who decide not 
to go to college do so because they cannot afford it and uses the point estimate from 
this survey as evidence. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide 
strong evidence supporting this statement.
\item Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of American adults 
who decide not to go to college because they cannot afford it to include 0.5? Explain.

\eoce[\MarginVideo{ahss_eoce_sol-taste_test_HT}]{\qt{Taste test\label{taste_test_HT}} Some people claim that they can tell the 
difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the first sip. A researcher 
wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such people. He then filled 80 plain 
white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked 
each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular. 53 
participants correctly identified the soda.
\begin{parts}
\item Do these data provide strong evidence that these people are able to detect the 
difference between diet and regular soda, in other words, are the results significantly 
better than just random guessing?
\item Interpret the p-value in this context.

Exercise~\ref{college_worth_it_HT_CI} presents the results of a poll where 48\% of 331 
Americans who decide to not go to college do so because they cannot afford it.
\begin{parts}
\item Calculate a 90\% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who decide 
to not go to college because they cannot afford it, and interpret the interval in

estimating the proportion of students at a university who smoke. Out of a random sample 
of 200 students from this university, 40 students smoke.
\begin{parts}
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of students at this 
university who smoke, and interpret this interval in context. (Reminder: Check 
conditions.)
\item If we wanted the margin of error to be no larger than 2\% at a 95\% confidence

\eoce{\qt{Legalize Marijuana, Part II\label{legalize_marijuana_CI_sample_size}} As 
discussed in Exercise~\ref{legalize_marijuana_CI_decision}, the 2010 General Social 
Survey reported a sample where about 48\% of US residents thought marijuana should be 
made legal. If we wanted to limit the margin of error of a 95\% confidence interval 
to 2\%, about how many Americans would we need to survey ?

\eoce{\qt{Public option, Part II\label{public_option_CI_sample_size}} 
Exercise~\ref{public_option_HT} presents the results of a poll evaluating support for 
the health care public option in 2009, reporting that 52\% of Independents in the 
sample opposed the public option. If we wanted to estimate this number to within 1\% 
with 90\% confidence, what would be an appropriate sample size?

\eoce{\qt{Acetaminophen and liver damage\label{acetaminophen_CI_sample_size}} It is 
believed that large doses of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in over the counter 
pain relievers like Tylenol) may cause damage to the liver. A researcher wants to 
conduct a study to estimate the proportion of acetaminophen users who have liver 
damage. For participating in this study, he will pay each subject \$20 and provide a 
free medical consultation if the patient has liver damage.
\begin{parts}
\item If he wants to limit the margin of error of his 98\% confidence interval to 2\%, 
what is the minimum amount of money he needs to set aside to pay his subjects?
\item The amount you calculated in part (a) is substantially over his budget so he 
decides to use fewer subjects. How will this affect the width of his confidence 
interval?

\eoce{\qt{Social experiment, Part I\label{social_experiment_conditions}} 
A ``social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do when they 
see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her boyfriend. On two different 
occasions at the same restaurant, the same couple was depicted. In one scenario the 
woman was dressed ``provocatively'' and in the other scenario the woman was dressed
``conservatively''. The table below shows how many restaurant diners were present under 
each scenario, and whether or not they intervened.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll cc c} 
            &       & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Scenario}} \\
\cline{3-4}
            &       & Provocative   & Conservative  & Total \\

interventions under provocative and conservative scenarios does not follow an 
approximately normal distribution.

\eoce{\qt{Heart transplant success\label{heart_transplant_conditions}} The Stanford 
University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental 
heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was 
officially designated a heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and 
might benefit from a new heart. Patients were randomly assigned into treatment and 
control groups. Patients in the treatment group received a transplant, and those in the 
control group did not. The table below displays how many patients survived and died in 
each group. \footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcc}
\hline
            & control   & treatment \\ 
\hline
alive       & 4         & 24 \\ 
dead        & 30        & 45 \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A hypothesis test would reject the conclusion that the survival rate is the same in 
each group, and so we might like to calculate a confidence interval. Explain why we 
cannot construct such an interval using the normal approximation. What might go wrong 
if we constructed the confidence interval despite this problem?

\eoce{\qt{Gender and color preference\label{gender_color_preference_CI_concept}} A 2001 
study asked 1,924 male and 3,666 female undergraduate college students their favorite 
color. A 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of males 
and females whose favorite color is black $(p_{male} - p_{female})$ was calculated to 
be (0.02, 0.06). Based on this information, determine if the following statements are 
true or false, and explain your reasoning for each statement you identify as 
false.\footfullcite{Ellis:2001}
\begin{parts}
\item We are 95\% confident that the true proportion of males whose favorite color is 
black is 2\% lower to 6\% higher than the true proportion of females whose favorite 
color is black.
\item We are 95\% confident that the true proportion of males whose favorite color is 
black is 2\% to 6\% higher than the true proportion of females whose favorite color is 
black.
\item 95\% of random samples will produce 95\% confidence intervals that include the 
true difference between the population proportions of males and females whose favorite 
color is black.
\item We can conclude that there is a significant difference between the proportions of 
males and females whose favorite color is black and that the difference between the two 
sample proportions is too large to plausibly be due to chance.
\item The 95\% confidence interval for $(p_{female} - p_{male})$ cannot be calculated 
with only the information given in this exercise.

degree in the poll watch The Daily Show. A 95\% confidence interval for 
$(p_\text{college grad} - p_\text{HS or less})$, where $p$ is the proportion of those 
who watch The Daily Show, is (0.07, 0.15). Based on this information, determine if the 
following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning if you identify the 
statement as false.\footfullcite{data:dailyShow}
\begin{parts}
\item At the 5\% significance level, the data provide convincing evidence of a 
difference between the proportions of college graduates and those with a high school 
degree or less who watch The Daily Show.
\item We are 95\% confident that 7\% less to 15\% more college graduates watch The 
Daily Show than those with a high school degree or less.
\item 95\% of random samples of 1,099 college graduates and 1,110 people with a high 
school degree or less will yield differences in sample proportions between 7\% and 15\%.
\item A 90\% confidence interval for $(p_\text{college grad} - p_\text{HS or less})$ 
would be wider.

\eoce{\qtq{How's it going\label{how_goes_country_chisq_GOF_indep}} The American 
National Election Studies (ANES) collects data on voter attitudes and intentions as 
well as demographic information. In this question we will focus on two variables from 
the 2012 ANES dataset:\footfullcite{data:anes:2012} 
\begin{itemize}
\item region (levels: Northeast, North Central, South, and West), and
\item whether the respondent feels things in this country are generally going in the 
right direction or things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track.
\end{itemize}
To keep calculations simple we will work with a random sample of 500 respondents from 
the ANES dataset. The distribution of responses are as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrr|r}
  \hline
                & Right  	& Wrong  	&  \\ 
                & Direction &  Track 	& Total \\ 
  \hline
Northeast       & 29        & 54        & 83 \\ 
North Central   & 44        & 77        & 121 \\ 
South           & 62        & 131       & 193 \\ 
West            & 36        & 67        & 103 \\ 
  \hline
Total           & 171       & 329       & 500 \\ 
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{parts}
\item Region: According to the 2010 Census, 18\% of US residents live in the 
Northeast, 22\% live in the North Central region, 37\% live in the South, and 23\% live 
in the West. Evaluate whether the ANES sample is representative of the population 
distribution of US residents. Make sure to clearly state the hypotheses, check 
conditions, calculate the appropriate test statistic and the p-value, and make your 
conclusion in context of the data. Also comment on what your conclusion says about 
whether or not this sample can be considered to be representative.
\item Region and direction:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item We would like to evaluate the relationship between region and feeling about the 
country's direction. What is the response variable and what is the explanatory variable?
\item What are the hypotheses for evaluating this relationship?
\item Complete the hypothesis test and interpret your results in context of the data 
and the research question.

\eoce{\qt{Bullying in schools\label{bullying_CI_small_sample_conditions}} A 2012 Survey 
USA poll asked Florida residents how big of a problem they thought bullying was in 
local schools. 9 out of 191 18-34 year olds responded that bullying is no problem at 
all. Using these data, is it appropriate to construct a confidence interval using the 
formula $\hat{p} \pm z^\star \sqrt{ \hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n }$ for the true proportion of 
18-34 year old Floridians who think bullying is no problem at all? If it is 
appropriate, construct the confidence interval. If it is not, explain why.

\eoce{\qt{The Egyptian Revolution\label{egypt_revolution_one_sample_randomization}} A 
popular uprising that started on January 25, 2011 in Egypt led to the 2011 Egyptian 
Revolution. Polls show that about 69\% of American adults followed the news about the 
political crisis and demonstrations in Egypt closely during the first couple weeks 
following the start of the uprising. Among a random sample of 30 high school 
students, it was found that only 17 of them followed the news about Egypt closely 
during this time. \footfullcite{data:egypt}

\begin{parts}

\item Write the hypotheses for testing if the proportion of high school students who 
followed the news about Egypt is different than the proportion of American adults who 
did.

\item Calculate the proportion of high schoolers in this sample who followed the news 
about Egypt closely during this time.

\item Based on large sample theory, we modeled $\hat{p}$ using the normal distribution. 
Why should we be cautious about this approach for these data?

\item The normal approximation will not be as reliable as a simulation, especially for 
a sample of this size. Describe how to perform such a simulation and, once you had 
results, how to estimate the p-value.

\item Below is a histogram showing the distribution of $\hat{p}_{sim}$ in 10,000 
simulations under the null hypothesis. Estimate the p-value using the plot and 
determine the conclusion of the hypothesis test.

\eoce{\qt{Assisted Reproduction\label{assisted_reproduction_one_sample_randomization}} 
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a collection of techniques that help 
facilitate pregnancy (e.g. in vitro fertilization). A 2008 report by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention estimated that ART has been successful in leading to a 
live birth in 31\% of cases \footfullcite{web:art}. A new fertility clinic claims that 
their success rate is higher than average. A random sample of 30 of their patients 
yielded a success rate of 40\%. A consumer watchdog group would like to determine if 
this provides strong evidence to support the company's claim.
\begin{parts}
\item Write the hypotheses to test if the success rate for ART at this clinic is 
significantly higher than the success rate reported by the CDC.
\item Based on large sample theory, we modeled $\hat{p}$ using the normal distribution. 
Why is this not appropriate here?
\item The normal approximation would be less reliable here, so we should use a 
simulation strategy. Describe a setup for a simulation that would be appropriate in 
this situation and how the p-value can be calculated using the simulation results.
\item Below is a histogram showing the distribution of $\hat{p}_{sim}$ in 10,000 
simulations under the null hypothesis. Estimate the p-value using the plot and use it 
to evaluate the hypotheses.
\item After performing this analysis, the consumer group releases the following news 
headline: ``Infertility clinic falsely advertises better success rates". Comment on the 
appropriateness of this statement.

\eoce{\qt{Social experiment, Part II\label{social_experiment_two_sample_randomization}} 
Exercise~\ref{social_experiment_conditions} introduces a ``social experiment" conducted 
by a TV program that questioned what people do when they see a very obviously bruised 
woman getting picked on by her boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same 
restaurant, the same couple was depicted. In one scenario the woman was dressed 
``provocatively" and in the other scenario the woman was dressed ``conservatively". The 
table below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and 
whether or not they intervened.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll cc c} 
            &               & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Scenario}} \\
\cline{3-4}
                            &       & Provocative   & Conservative  & Total \\
\cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{\textit{Intervene}} &Yes & 5   & 15  & 20    \\
                            &No     & 15      & 10  & 25 \\
\cline{2-5}
                            &Total  & 20      & 25  & 45 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A simulation was conducted to test if people react differently under the two scenarios. 
10,000 simulated differences were generated to construct the null distribution shown. 
The value $\hat{p}_{pr, sim}$ represents the proportion of diners who intervened in the 
simulation for the provocatively dressed woman, and $\hat{p}_{con, sim}$ is the 
proportion for the conservatively dressed woman.

\begin{parts}
\item What are the hypotheses? For the purposes of this exercise, you may assume that 
each observed person at the restaurant behaved independently, though we would want to 
evaluate this assumption more rigorously if we were reporting these results.
\item Calculate the observed difference between the rates of intervention under the 
provocative and conservative scenarios: $\hat{p}_{pr} - \hat{p}_{con}$.
\item Estimate the p-value using the figure above and determine the conclusion of the 
hypothesis test.

\eoce{\qtq{Is yawning contagious\label{yawning_two_sample_randomization}} An experiment 
conducted by the \textit{MythBusters}, a science entertainment TV program on the 
Discovery Channel, tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if 
another person near them yawns. 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a 
group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a group where there wasn't 
a person yawning near them (control). The following table shows the results of this 
experiment. \footfullcite{data:yawn}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll cc c} 
            &               & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Group}} \\
\cline{3-4}
                            &           & Treatment & Control   & Total \\
\cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{\textit{Result}}        &Yawn       & 10        & 4     & 14    \\
                            &Not Yawn   & 24        & 12        & 36 \\
\cline{2-5}
                            &Total      & 34        & 16        & 50 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A simulation was conducted to understand the distribution of the test statistic under 
the assumption of independence: having someone yawn near another person has no 
influence on if the other person will yawn. In order to conduct the simulation, a 
researcher wrote yawn on 14 index cards and not yawn on 36 index cards to indicate 
whether or not a person yawned. Then he shuffled the cards and dealt them into two 
groups of size 34 and 16 for treatment and control, respectively. He counted how many 
participants in each simulated group yawned in an apparent response to a nearby yawning 
person, and calculated the difference between the simulated proportions of yawning as 
$\hat{p}_{trtmt,sim} - \hat{p}_{ctrl,sim}$. This simulation was repeated 10,000 times 
using software to obtain 10,000 differences that are due to chance alone. The histogram 
shows the distribution of the simulated differences.
