\eoce{\qt{Income and gender\label{income_gender}} The relative frequency table 
below displays the distribution of annual total personal income (in 2009 
inflation-adjusted dollars) for a representative sample of 96,420,486 Americans. 
These data come from the American Community Survey for 2005-2009. This sample is 
comprised of 59\% males and 41\% females. \footfullcite{acsIncome2005-2009} \\

\begin{parts}
\item Describe the distribution of total personal income.
\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen US resident makes less than 
\$50,000 per year?
\item What is the probability that a randomly chosen US resident makes less than 
\$50,000 per year and is female? Note any assumptions you make.
\item The same data source indicates that 71.8\% of females make less than 
\$50,000 per year. Use this value to determine whether or not the assumption you 
made in part (c) is valid.
