In this section we will explore techniques for
summarizing numerical variables.
For example, consider the \var{loan\us{}amount} variable
from the \data{loan50} data set, which represents the loan
size for all 50 loans in the data set.
This variable is numerical since we can sensibly discuss
the numerical difference of the size of two loans.
On the other hand, area codes and zip codes are not numerical,
but rather they are categorical variables.

Throughout this section and the next, we will apply these
methods using the \data{loan50} and \data{county} data sets,
which were introduced in Section~\ref{dataBasics}.
If you'd like to review the variables from either data set,
see Figures~\ref{loan50DF} and~\ref{countyDF}.


\subsection{Scatterplots for paired data}
\label{scatterPlots}

\index{data!loan50|(}

A \term{scatterplot} provides a case-by-case view of data
for two numerical variables.
In Figure~\ref{multiunitsVsOwnership} on
page~\pageref{multiunitsVsOwnership}, a scatterplot
was used to examine the homeownership rate against
the fraction of housing units that were part of
multi-unit properties
(e.g. apartments) in the \data{county} data set.
Another scatterplot is shown in Figure~\ref{loan50_amt_vs_income},
comparing the total income of a borrower
(\var{total\us{}income}) and the amount they borrowed
(\var{loan\us{}amount}) for the \data{loan50} data set.
In any scatterplot, each point represents a single case.
Since there are \loanN{} cases in \data{loan50},
there are \loanN{} points in Figure~\ref{loan50_amt_vs_income}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure
    [A scatterplot is shown with "Total Income" along the horizontal axis (range from \$0 to \$325,000) and "Loan Amount" along the vertical axis (range from \$0 to \$40,000). The points lie in a range from \$2,000 to \$33,000 in loan amount when total income is smaller than \$150,000 (representing most of the points). The range of loan amounts is higher when total income is greater than \$175,000, with the range of observations being about \$15,000 to \$40,000.]
    {0.8}{loan50_amt_vs_income}
  \caption{A scatterplot of \var{total\us{}income}
      versus \var{loan\us{}amount} for the
      \data{loan50} data set.}
  \label{loan50_amt_vs_income}
\end{figure}

Looking at Figure~\ref{loan50_amt_vs_income},
we see that there are many borrowers with an income below
\$100,000 on the left side of the graph,
while there are a handful of borrowers with income above~\$250,000.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Figure~\ref{medianHHIncomePoverty}
    shows a plot of median household income
    against the poverty rate for 3,142 counties.
    What can be said about the relationship between
    these variables?}
  The relationship is evidently \term{nonlinear},
  as highlighted by the dashed line.
  This is different from previous scatterplots we've seen,
  which show relationships that do not show much, if any,
  curvature in the trend.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

    [A scatterplot of a few thousand points is shown with "Poverty Rate" along the horizontal axis (range from 0\% to 55\%) and "Median Household Income" along the vertical axis (range from \$0 to \$130,000). A curved trend line is overlaid on the points starting higher on the left and decreasing as it moves right, but it starts flattening the further right it goes. Below 10\% poverty rate, points range from about \$40,000 to \$130,000. Between 10\% to 20\%, the range is lower at about \$25,000 to close to \$100,000. For 20\% to 30\%, the points ranges from about \$22,000 to just over \$60,000. For 30\% to 50\%, the trend is mostly flat with values ranging from about \$20,000 to \$50,000.]

\subsection{Dot plots and the mean}
\label{dotPlot}

Sometimes two variables are one too many:
only one variable may be of interest.
In these cases, a dot plot provides the most basic of displays.
A~\term{dot plot} is a one-variable scatterplot;
an example using the interest rate of \loanN{} loans
is shown in Figure~\ref{loan_int_rate_dot_plot}.
A stacked version of this dot plot is shown in
Figure~\ref{loan_int_rate_dot_plot_stacked}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure
    [A dot plot is shown for the variable "Interest Rate". There is a horizontal axis ranging from about 5\% to a bit over 25\%, and then several points are shown horizontally above the axis, scattered over the range. There is a higher density of points between 5\% to 11\%, with a moderate density of points from 12\% to about 20\%, and then a few more observations at about 22\%, 25\%, and 26\%. A red triangle is also shown at approximately 12\%.]

      distribution's mean is shown as a red triangle.}

\end{figure}

\D{\newpage}

The \term{mean}, often called the
\term{average}\index{mean!average}, is a common way
to measure the center of a \mbox{\term{distribution}} of data.
To compute the mean interest rate, we add up all the interest
rates and divide by the number of observations:
\begin{align*}
\bar{x}
    = \frac{\text{\loanA\%} + \text{\loanB\%} + \text{\loanC\%} +
        \cdots + \text{\loanZ\%}}{\loanN{}}
    = \loanAvg{}\%
% library(openintro); loan50$interest_rate[c(1:3, 50)]; mean(loan50$interest_rate)
\end{align*}
The sample mean is often labeled $\bar{x}$.
The letter $x$ is being used as a generic placeholder
for the variable of interest, \var{interest\us{}rate},
and the bar over the $x$ communicates we're looking at the
average interest rate, which for these 50 loans was \loanAvg{}\%.
It is useful to think of the mean as the balancing point
of the distribution, and it's shown as a triangle in Figures~\ref{loan_int_rate_dot_plot}
and~\ref{loan_int_rate_dot_plot_stacked}.

\begin{onebox}{Mean}%
The sample mean can be computed as the sum of the
observed values divided by the number of observations:
\begin{align*}
\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}
\end{align*}
where $x_1$, $x_2$, $\dots$, $x_n$ represent
the $n$ observed values.
\end{onebox}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Examine the equation for the mean.
What does $x_1$ correspond to? And $x_2$?
Can you infer a general meaning to what $x_i$
might represent?\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{$x_1$ corresponds to the
  interest rate for the first loan in the sample (\loanA\%),
  $x_2$ to the second loan's interest rate (\loanB\%),
  and $x_i$ corresponds to the interest rate for the
  $i^{th}$ loan in the data set.
  For example, if $i = 4$, then we're examining $x_4$,
  which refers to the fourth observation in the data set.}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
What was $n$ in this sample of
loans?\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{The sample size was $n = 50$.}

The \data{loan50} data set represents a sample from
a larger population of loans made through Lending Club.
We could compute a mean for this population in the same way
as the sample mean.
However, the population mean has a special label: $\mu$.
\index{Greek!mu@mu ($\mu$)}
The symbol $\mu$ is the Greek letter \emph{mu} and represents
the average of all observations in the population.
Sometimes a subscript, such as $_x$,
is used to represent which variable the population mean
refers to, e.g. $\mu_x$.
Often times it is too expensive to measure the
population mean precisely, so we often estimate
$\mu$ using the sample mean, $\bar{x}$.

\D{\newpage}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{The average interest rate across all loans
    in the population can be estimated using the sample data.
    Based on the sample of 50 loans,
    what would be a reasonable estimate of $\mu_x$,
    the mean interest rate for all loans in the
    full data set?}
  The sample mean, \loanAvg{}\%, provides a rough estimate
  of $\mu_x$.
  While it's not perfect, this is our single best guess
  %\emph{point estimate}\index{point estimate}
  of the average interest rate of all the loans in the
  population under study.

  In Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference} and beyond,
  we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy
  of \emph{point estimates}\index{point estimate}
  like the sample mean.
  As you might have guessed,
  point estimates based on larger samples tend to be
  more accurate than those based on smaller samples.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}


\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{The mean is useful because it allows us to
    rescale or standardize a metric into something more easily
    interpretable and comparable.
    Provide 2 examples where the mean
    is useful for making comparisons.}

  1. We would like to understand if a new drug is more
  effective at treating asthma attacks than the standard drug.
  A trial of 1500 adults is set up, where 500 receive the new
  drug, and 1000 receive a standard drug in the control
  group:\vspace{-2mm}
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l cc}
  %\hline
  &           New drug & Standard drug \\
  \hline
  Number of patients   & 500 & 1000 \\
  Total asthma attacks & 200 & 300 \\
  \hline
  %average attacks
  %per patient    & 0.4 & 0.2 \\
  %\hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  Comparing the raw counts of 200 to 300 asthma attacks
  would make it appear that the new drug is better,
  but this is an artifact of the imbalanced group sizes.
  Instead, we should look at the average number of asthma
  attacks per patient in each group:
  \begin{align*}
  & \text{New drug: } 200 / 500 = 0.4 % \\
      %\frac{200}{500} = 0.4 % \\
  && \text{Standard drug: } 300 / 1000 = 0.3
      %\frac{300}{1000} = 0.3
  % &     &&  %\\
  % & = 0.3\text{ asthma attacks per patient}
  %     && = 0.4\text{ asthma attacks per patient}
  \end{align*}
  The standard drug has a lower average number of asthma
  attacks per patient than the average in the treatment group.

  2. Emilio opened a food truck last year where he sells burritos,
  and his business has stabilized over the last 3 months.
  Over that 3 month period, he has made \$11,000 while
  working 625 hours.
  Emilio's average hourly earnings provides
  a useful statistic for evaluating whether his venture is,
  at~least from a financial perspective, worth it:
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{\$11000}{625\text{ hours}} = \$17.60\text{ per hour}
  \end{align*}
  By knowing his average hourly wage,
  Emilio now has put his earnings into a standard unit that
  is easier to compare with many other jobs that he might
  consider.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

%{What are some contexts that highlight
%    the value of the mean?}
%  Here are a few scenarios highlighting why the mean can be
%  particularly useful.
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item If a waitress makes an average of \$3.20 per table,
%      then she can get a reasonable estimate of how much
%      money she will make if she knows she'll turn over
%      about 15 tables in a night:
%      \begin{align*}
%      total &= average \times count
%          = \$3.20 \times 15
%          = \$48.00
%      \begin{align*}
%      The estimate won't be perfect, but it will still
%      be a useful reference of what she can expect.
%  \item For every \$1 played on roulette,
%      a gambler will lose, on average, 2.7 cents.
%      If she plays 1000 games and bets \$1 each time,
%      her expected loss is
%      \begin{align*}
%      total = average \times count
%          = 2.7 \cents \times 1000
%          = \$27
%      \begin{align*}
%  \end{itemize}
%  The average provides us a sensible value to think
%  about scaling gains and losses.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Suppose we want to compute the average income
    per person in the US.
    To do so, we might first think to take
    the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties
    in the \data{county} data set.
    What would be a better approach?}
    \label{wtdMeanOfIncome}
  The \data{county} data set is special in that each county
  actually represents many individual people.
  If we were to simply average across the \var{income}
  variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and
  5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations.
  Instead, we should compute the total income for each county,
  add up all the counties' totals, and then divide by the number
  of people in all the counties.
  If we completed these steps with the \data{county} data,
  we would find that the per capita income for the US is
  \$30,861.
  Had we computed the \emph{simple} mean of per capita income
  across counties, the result would have been just \$26,093!

  This example used what is called a
  \term{weighted mean}\index{mean!weighted mean}.

\subsection{Histograms and shape}
\label{histogramsAndShape}

Dot plots show the exact value for each observation.
This is useful for small data sets, but they can become
hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the
value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value
as belonging to a \emph{bin}.
For example, in the \data{loan50} data set, we created
a table of counts for the number of loans with interest
rates between 5.0\% and 7.5\%, then the number of loans
with rates between 7.5\% and 10.0\%, and so on.
Observations that fall on the boundary of a bin
(e.g. 10.00\%) are allocated to the lower bin.
This tabulation is shown in Figure~\ref{binnedIntRateAmountTable}.
These binned counts are plotted as bars in
Figure~\ref{loan50IntRateHist} into what is called
a \term{histogram}, which resembles a more heavily binned
version of the stacked dot plot shown in
Figure~\ref{loan_int_rate_dot_plot_stacked}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering\small
\begin{tabular}{l ccc ccc ccc}
  \hline
  Interest Rate &
      5.0\% - 7.5\% &
      7.5\% - 10.0\% &

      12.5\% - 15.0\% &
      $\cdots$ &
      25.0\% - 27.5\% \\
  \hline
  Count & 11 & 15 & 8 & 4 & $\cdots$ & 1 \\

    {0.76}{loan50IntRateHist}
  \caption{A histogram of \var{interest\us{}rate}.
      This distribution is strongly skewed to the right.
      \index{skew!strong}}
  \label{loan50IntRateHist}
\end{figure}

Histograms provide a view of the \term{data density}.
Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common.
For instance, there are many more loans with rates between
5\%~and~10\% than loans with rates between 20\% and~25\%
in the data set.
The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data
changes relative to the interest rate.

Histograms are especially convenient for understanding the
shape of the data distribution\label{shapeFirstDiscussed}.
Figure~\ref{loan50IntRateHist} suggests that most loans
have rates under 15\%, while only a handful
of loans have rates above 20\%.
When data trail off to the right in this way
and has a longer right \hiddenterm{tail}\index{skew!tail},
the shape is said to be
\termsub{right skewed}{skew!right skewed}.\footnote{Other
  ways to describe data that are right skewed:
  \termni{skewed to the right},
  \termni{skewed to the high end},
  or \termni{skewed to the positive end}.}

Data sets with the reverse characteristic --
a long, thinner tail to the left --
are said to be \termsub{left skewed}{skew!left skewed}.
We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail.
Data sets that show roughly equal trailing off in both
directions are called \term{symmetric}.\index{skew!symmetric}

\begin{onebox}{Long tails to identify skew}
  When data trail off in one direction, the distribution
  has a \term{long tail}. \index{skew!long tail|textbf}
  If a distribution has a long left tail, it is left skewed.
  If a distribution has a long right tail, it is right skewed.
\end{onebox}

In addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed
or symmetric, histograms can be used to identify modes.
A \term{mode} is represented by a prominent peak in the
distribution.
There is only one prominent peak in the histogram of
\var{loan\us{}amount}.

A definition of \emph{mode} sometimes
taught in math classes is the value with the
most occurrences in the data set.
However, for many real-world data sets, it is common to have
\emph{no} observations with the same value in a data set,
making this definition impractical in data analysis.

Figure~\ref{singleBiMultiModalPlots} shows histograms that
have one, two, or three prominent peaks.
Such distributions are called
\term{unimodal},
\term{bimodal}, and
\term{multimodal}, respectively.
Any distribution with more than 2~prominent peaks is
called multimodal.
Notice that there was one prominent peak in the unimodal
distribution with a second less prominent peak that was
not counted since it only differs from its neighboring
bins by a few observations.

    [Three histograms are shown. The first histogram shows bins of width 2 between 0 to 18 (this is along the horizontal axis), and the frequencies are 3, 16, 16, 7, 11, 6, 4, 1, and 1. The second histogram, representing a different data set, shows bins of width 2 with values ranging from 0 to 20, where the bin counts in order are 2, 9, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 10, 19, and 9.

%{Looking back the stacked dot plot in

%  What we found is that the bumps evident in the dot plot
%  tend to happen at \$5,000 increments.
%  That is, people made loan requests in round amounts.
%  While that is interesting, we often are more interested

%  than characterizing some special property like this,
%  and for this reason, we think the data set is better
%  described as unimodal.
%  However, this example highlights that there isn't
%  always one ``correct'' answer for the number of modes.
%
%  There's a broader lesson to take away
%  from this example:

Looking for modes isn't about finding a clear and correct

rigorously defined in this book.
The most important part of this examination is to better

\subsection{Variance and standard deviation}
\label{variability}

The mean was introduced as a method to describe the center of
a data set, and \indexthis{variability}{variability} in the
data is also important.
Here, we introduce two measures of variability:
the variance and the standard deviation.
Both of these are very useful in data analysis,
even though their formulas are a bit tedious to calculate
by hand.
The standard deviation is the easier of the two to comprehend,
and it roughly describes how far away the typical observation
is from the mean.

We call the distance of an observation from its mean its \term{deviation}. Below are the deviations for the $1^{st}_{}$, $2^{nd}_{}$, $3^{rd}$, and $50^{th}_{}$ observations in the \var{interest\us{}rate} variable:
\begin{align*}
x_1^{}-\bar{x} &= \loanA - \loanAvg{} = \loanAdev \hspace{5mm}\text{ } \\
x_2^{}-\bar{x} &= \loanB - \loanAvg{} = \loanBdev \\
x_3^{}-\bar{x} &= \loanC - \loanAvg{} = \loanCdev \\
			&\ \vdots \\
x_{50}^{}-\bar{x} &= \loanZ - \loanAvg{} = \loanZdev
\end{align*}
If we square these deviations and then take an average,
the result is equal to the sample
\term{variance}\label{varianceIsDefined},
denoted by $s_{}^2$:
\begin{align*}
s_{}^2 &= \frac{(\loanAdev)_{}^2 + (\loanBdev)_{}^2 + (\loanCdev)_{}^2 + \cdots + (\loanZdev)_{}^2}{\loanN{}-1} \\
	&= \frac{0.45 + 2.72 + 216.97 + \cdots + 30.14}{49} \\
	&= \loanVar{}
\end{align*}
We divide by $n - 1$, rather than dividing by $n$,
when computing a sample's variance;
there's some mathematical nuance here, but the end result is that
doing this makes this statistic slightly more reliable and useful.

Notice that squaring the deviations does two things.
First, it makes large values relatively much larger,
seen by comparing $(\loanAdev)^2$, $(\loanBdev)^2$, $(\loanCdev)^2$,
and $(\loanZdev)^2$.
Second, it gets rid of any negative signs.

The \term{standard deviation} is defined as the square root of the variance:
\begin{align*}
s = \sqrt{\loanVar{}} = \loanSD{}
\end{align*}
While often omitted, a subscript of $_x$ may be added
to the variance and standard deviation,
i.e. $s_x^2$ and $s_x^{}$, if it is useful as a reminder
that these are the variance and standard deviation of the
observations represented by $x_1^{}$, $x_2^{}$, ..., $x_n^{}$.

\begin{onebox}{Variance and standard deviation}
  The variance is the average squared distance from the mean.
  The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
  The standard deviation is useful when considering how far
  the data are distributed from the mean.\vspace{3mm}

  The standard deviation represents the typical deviation
  of observations from the mean.
  Usually about 70\% of the data will be within one standard
  deviation of the mean and about 95\% will be within two
  standard deviations.
  However, as seen in Figures~\ref{sdRuleForIntRate}
  and~\ref{severalDiffDistWithSdOf1}, these percentages are
  not strict rules.
\end{onebox}

Like the mean, the population values for variance
and standard deviation have special symbols:
$\sigma_{}^2$ for the variance and $\sigma$ for the
standard deviation.
The symbol $\sigma$\index{Greek!sigma@sigma ($\sigma$)}
is the Greek letter \emph{sigma}.

  complete story, we can use modality and shape

  The distribution of interest rates is unimodal
  and skewed to the high end.
  Many of the rates fall near the mean at 11.57\%,
  and most fall within one standard deviation (5.05\%)

In practice, the variance and standard deviation are sometimes
used as a means to an end, where the ``end'' is being able to
accurately estimate the uncertainty associated with a sample
statistic.
For example, in Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference}
the standard deviation is used in calculations that help us
understand how much a sample mean varies from one sample
to the next.

\subsection{Box plots, quartiles, and the median}

A \term{box plot} summarizes a data set using five
statistics while also plotting unusual observations.
Figure~\ref{loan_int_rate_box_plot_layout} provides
a vertical dot plot alongside a box plot of the
\var{interest\us{}rate} variable from
the \data{loan50} data set.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure
    [What is shown in a a dot plot adjacent to what is called a "box plot". The data values are the same ones used in past dot plots, where the data shows greatest density from 5\% to 11\%, moderate density from 12\% to 20\%, and then a few more values at about 22\%, 25\%, and 26\%. The box plot adjacent to the data shows a box that would encapsulate the middle 50\% of the data, from about 8\% to 13\%. The median is also annotated with a line through the center of the box. From here, the data extend out with "whiskers" up to a distance up to $1.5 \times IQR$ below and above the box to capture as much data as possible. There are two observations that extend beyond this range at 25\% and 26\%.]
    {0.86}{loan_int_rate_box_plot_layout}
  \caption{A vertical dot plot, where points have been
      horizontally stacked, next to a labeled box plot
      for the interest rates of the \loanN{} loans.}
  \label{loan_int_rate_box_plot_layout}
\end{figure}

The first step in building a box plot is drawing a dark line
denoting the \term{median}, which splits the data in half.
Figure~\ref{loan_int_rate_box_plot_layout} shows 50\% of the
data falling below the median and other 50\% falling above
the median.
There are \loanN{} loans in the data set
(an even number) so the data are perfectly split into two
groups of~25.
We take the median in this case to be the average of the
two observations closest to the $50^{th}$ percentile,
which happen to be the same value in this data set:
$(\text{\loanMedianAbove{}} + \text{\loanMedianBelow{}}) / 2
  = \text{\loanMedian{}}$.
When there are an odd number of observations,
there will be exactly one observation that splits the data
into two halves, and in such a case that observation
is the median (no average needed).

\begin{onebox}{Median: the number in the middle}
  If the data are ordered from smallest to largest,
  the \term{median} is the observation right in the middle.
  If there are an even number of observations,
  there will be two values in the middle,
  and the median is taken as their average.
\end{onebox}

The second step in building a box plot is drawing
a rectangle to represent the middle 50\% of the data.
The total length of the box, shown vertically in
Figure~\ref{loan_int_rate_box_plot_layout},
is called the \term{interquartile range} (\hiddenterm{IQR},
for short).
It, like the standard deviation, is a measure
of \indexthis{variability}{variability} in data.
The more variable the data, the larger the standard
deviation and~IQR tend to be.
The two boundaries of the box are called the
\term{first quartile} \index{quartile!first quartile}
(the $25^{th}$ \hiddenterm{percentile},
i.e. 25\% of the data fall below this value)
and the \term{third quartile} \index{quartile!third quartile}
(the $75^{th}$ percentile), and these are often labeled $Q_1$
\index{quartile!Q1@Q$_1$} and $Q_3$\index{quartile!Q3@Q$_3$},
respectively.

\begin{onebox}{Interquartile range (IQR)}
  The IQR\index{interquartile range} is the length
  of the box in a box plot.
  It is computed as
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  IQR = Q_3 - Q_1
  \end{eqnarray*}
  where $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ are the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$
  percentiles.
\end{onebox}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
What percent of the data fall between $Q_1$ and the median?
What percent is between the median and $Q_3$?\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{Since
  $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ capture the middle 50\% of the data and
  the median splits the data in the middle, 25\% of the data
  fall between $Q_1$ and the median, and another 25\% falls
  between the median and $Q_3$.}

Extending out from the box, the \term{whiskers} attempt
to capture the data outside of the box.
However, their reach is never allowed to be more than
$1.5\times IQR$.
They capture everything within this reach.
In Figure~\ref{loan_int_rate_box_plot_layout},
the upper whisker does not extend to the last two points,
which is beyond $Q_3 + 1.5\times IQR$,
and so it extends only to the last point below this limit.
The lower whisker stops at the lowest value,
\loanSmallestValue{}\%,
since there is no additional data to reach;
the lower whisker's limit is not shown in the figure because
the plot does not extend down to $Q_1 - 1.5\times IQR$.
In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot
and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the
rest of the data.

Any observation lying beyond the whiskers is labeled with a dot.
The purpose of labeling these points --
instead of extending the whiskers to the minimum
and maximum observed values --
is to help identify any observations that appear to be
unusually distant from the rest of the data.
Unusually distant observations are called
\termsub{outliers}{outlier}.
In this case, it would be reasonable to classify the
interest rates of 24.85\% and \loanLargestValue{}\%
as outliers since they are numerically distant from
most of the data.

\begin{onebox}{Outliers are extreme}
  An \term{outlier} is an observation that appears
  extreme relative to the rest of the data. \vspace{3mm}
  
  Examining data for outliers serves
  many useful purposes, including\vspace{-1mm}

  \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
  \item Identifying
      \indexthis{strong skew}{skew!strong}

\footnotetext{(a)~Mean is affected more.

  Complete explanations are provided in the material

The median and IQR are called \term{robust statistics} because
extreme observations have little effect on their values:
moving the most extreme value generally has little influence
on these statistics.
On the other hand, the mean and standard deviation
are more heavily influenced by changes in extreme observations,
which can be important in some situations.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{The median and IQR did not change under the

    What isn't useful about this plot?}
  Nearly all of the data fall into the left-most bin,
  and the extreme skew obscures many of the potentially
  interesting details in the data.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

There are some standard transformations that may be
useful for strongly right skewed data where much of the
data is positive but clustered near zero.
A \term{transformation} is a rescaling of the data
using a function.
For instance, a plot of the logarithm (base 10) of
county populations results in the new histogram in
Figure~\ref{county_pop_transformed_log}.
This data is symmetric, and any potential outliers
appear much less extreme than in the original data set.
By reigning in the outliers and extreme skew,
transformations like this often make it easier to build
statistical models against the data.

Transformations can also be applied to one or both
variables in a scatterplot.
A scatterplot of the population change from 2010 to 2017
against the population in 2010 is shown in Figure~\ref{county_pop_change_v_pop_transform_i}.
In this first scatterplot, it's hard to decipher any
interesting patterns because the population variable
is so strongly skewed.
However, if we apply a log$_{10}$ transformation to
the population variable, as shown in
Figure~\ref{county_pop_change_v_pop_transform_log},
a positive association between the variables is revealed.
In fact, we may be interested in fitting a trend line to
the data when we explore methods around fitting regression
lines in Chapter~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar}.

Transformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too.
For instance, the square root
($\sqrt{\text{original observation}}$) and inverse
($\frac{1}{\text{original observation}}$) are commonly used
by data scientists.
Common goals in transforming data are to see the data
structure differently, reduce skew, assist in modeling,
or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot.

\subsection{Mapping data (special topic)}

\index{data!county|(}
%\index{intensity map|(}

The \data{county} data set offers many numerical variables
that we could plot using dot plots, scatterplots,
or box plots, but these miss the true nature of the data.
Rather, when we encounter geographic data, we should create
an \term{intensity map}, where colors are used
to show higher and lower values of a variable.
Figures~\ref{countyIntensityMaps1}
and~\ref{countyIntensityMaps2} shows intensity maps for
poverty rate in percent (\var{poverty}),
unemployment rate (\var{unemployment\us{}rate}),
homeownership rate in percent (\var{homeownership}),
and median household income
(\var{median\us{}hh\us{}income}).
The color key indicates which colors correspond to which values.
The intensity maps are not generally very helpful
for getting precise values in any given county,
but they are very helpful for seeing geographic trends
and generating interesting research questions or hypotheses.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{What interesting features are evident in the
    \var{poverty} and \var{unemployment\us{}rate}
    intensity maps?}\label{map_example_poverty_and_unemployment}
  Poverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations.
  Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates,
  as does much of Arizona and New Mexico.
  High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi
  flood plains a little north of New Orleans and
  also in a large section of Kentucky.

  The unemployment rate follows similar trends,
  and we can see correspondence between the two
  variables. In fact, it makes sense for higher rates
  of unemployment to be closely related to poverty rates.
  One observation that stand out when comparing the two maps:
  the poverty rate is much higher than the unemployment
  rate, meaning while many people may be working,
  they are not making enough to break out of poverty.
\end{nexample}

  There is some correspondence between high earning

  try to spot them on the map as dark spots.}

\section{Considering categorical data}
\label{categoricalData}

\index{data!loans|(}

In this section, we will introduce tables and other basic tools
for categorical data that are used throughout this book.
The \data{loan50} data set represents a sample from a larger
loan data set called \data{loans}.
This larger data set contains information on 10,000 loans made
through Lending Club.
We~will examine the relationship between
\var{homeownership}, which for the \data{loans} data can take
a value of \resp{rent}, \resp{mortgage}
(owns but has a mortgage), or \resp{own},
and \var{app\us{}type},
which indicates whether the loan application was made
with a partner or whether it was an individual application.

Figure~\ref{loan_home_app_type_totals} summarizes two variables:
\var{app\us{}type}
%\footnote{For those readers already familiar
%  with \emph{joint probabilities}, \resp{joint} in the table
%  refers to a level of the \var{app\us{}type} variable
%  for a joint application.
%  The does not refer to a joint probability!}
and \var{homeownership}.
A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in
this way is called a \term{contingency table}.
Each value in the table represents the number of times
a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred.
For example, the value \loanapphomeAA{} corresponds to the number of
loans in the data set where the borrower rents their home
and the application type was by an individual.
Row and column totals are also included.
The \term{row totals} \index{contingency table!row totals}
provide the total counts across each row
(e.g. $\loanapphomeAA{} + \loanapphomeAB{} +
  \loanapphomeAC{} = \loanapphomeAD{}$),
and \term{column totals} \index{contingency table!column totals}
are total counts down each column.
We can also create a table that shows only the overall 
percentages or proportions for each combination of categories,
or we can create a table for a single variable,
such as the one shown in Figure~\ref{loan_homeownership_totals}
for the \var{homeownership} variable.

A bar plot is a common way to display a single
categorical variable.
The left panel of Figure~\ref{loan_homeownership_bar_plot}
shows a \term{bar plot} for the \var{homeownership} variable.
In the right panel, the counts are converted into proportions,
showing the proportion of observations that are in each level
(e.g. $\loanapphomeDA{} / \loanapphomeDD{} = 0.3858$ for
  \resp{rent}).

For example, the "Rent" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to a frequency of about 3900. The "Mortgage" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to about 4700, and the bar for "Own" extends up to at about 1300. Moving to the next plot, the right bar plot, it looks very similar to the left bar plot except that it reports the proportion of cases on the vertical axes instead of the frequency (count). The values in this bar plot are: about 0.39 for Rent, about 0.47 for Mortgage, and about 0.13 for Own.]

\subsection{Row and column proportions}

Sometimes it is useful to understand the fractional breakdown
of one variable in another,
and we can modify our contingency table to provide such a view.
Figure~\ref{rowPropAppTypeHomeownership}
shows the
\termsub{row proportions}{contingency table!row proportions}
for Figure~\ref{loan_home_app_type_totals},
which are computed as the counts divided by their row totals.
The value \loanapphomeAA{} at the intersection of
\resp{individual} and \resp{rent} is replaced by
$\loanapphomeAA{}/\loanapphomeAD{} = 0.411$,
i.e. \loanapphomeAA{} divided by its row total,
\loanapphomeAD{}.
So what does 0.411 represent?
It corresponds to the proportion of individual
applicants who rent.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{tabular}
\caption{A contingency table with row proportions

    \resp{joint} row due to a rounding error.}
\label{rowPropAppTypeHomeownership}
\end{figure}

A contingency table of the column proportions is computed in
a similar way, where each
\termsub{column proportion}{contingency table!column proportion}
is computed as the count divided by the corresponding column total.
Figure~\ref{colPropAppTypeHomeownership} shows such a table,
and here the value 0.906 indicates that 90.6\% of renters applied
as individuals for the loan.
This rate is higher compared to loans from people with
mortgages (80.2\%) or who own their home (86.5\%).
Because these rates vary between the three levels of
\var{homeownership} (\resp{rent}, \resp{mortgage}, \resp{own}),
this provides evidence that the \var{app\us{}type} and
\var{homeownership} variables are associated.

\label{colPropAppTypeHomeownership}
\end{figure}

We could also have checked for an association between \var{app\us{}type} and \var{homeownership} in Figure~\ref{rowPropAppTypeHomeownership} using row proportions. When comparing these row proportions, we would look down columns to see if the fraction of loans where the borrower rents, has a mortgage, or owns varied across the \resp{individual} to \resp{joint} application types.

\begin{nexample}{
    Data scientists use statistics to filter spam from incoming
    email messages.
    By noting specific characteristics of an email,
    a data scientist may be able to classify some emails as spam
    or not spam with high accuracy.
    One such characteristic is whether the email
    contains no numbers, small numbers, or big numbers.
    Another characteristic is the email format, which
    indicates whether or not an email has any HTML content,
    such as bolded text.
    We'll focus on email format and spam status using the
    \data{email} data set, and these variables are summarized
    in a contingency table in
    Figure~\ref{emailSpamHTMLTableTotals}.
    Which would be more helpful to someone hoping to classify
    email as spam or regular email for this table:
    row or column proportions?}
  \label{weighingRowColumnProportions}
  A data scientist would be interested in how the proportion
  of spam changes within each email format.
  This corresponds to column proportions:
  the proportion of spam in plain text emails
  and the proportion of spam in HTML emails.

  If we generate the column proportions, we can see
  that a higher fraction of plain text emails are
  spam ($209/1195 = 17.5\%$)
  than compared to HTML emails ($158/2726 = 5.8\%$).
  This information on its own is insufficient to classify
  an email as spam or not spam, as over 80\% of plain text
  emails are not spam.
  Yet, when we carefully combine this information with many
  other characteristics,
  we stand a reasonable chance of being able to classify
  some emails as spam or not spam with confidence.

Example~\ref{weighingRowColumnProportions} points out
that row and column proportions are not equivalent.
Before settling on one form for a table,
it is important to consider each to ensure that the
most useful table is constructed.
However, sometimes it simply isn't clear which, if either,
is more useful.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Look back to
    Tables~\ref{rowPropAppTypeHomeownership}
    and~\ref{colPropAppTypeHomeownership}.
    Are there any obvious scenarios where one might be more
    useful than the other?}
  None that we thought were obvious!
  What is distinct about \var{app\us{}type}
  and \var{homeownership} vs the email example is that
  these two variables don't have a clear explanatory-response
  variable relationship that we might hypothesize
  (see Section~\ref{explanatoryAndResponse} for these terms).
  Usually it is most useful to ``condition'' on the
  explanatory variable.
  For instance, in the email example, the email format
  was seen as a possible explanatory variable of whether
  the message was spam, so we would find it more interesting
  to compute the relative frequencies (proportions)
  for each email format.
\end{nexample}

\subsection{Using a bar plot with two variables}
\label{bar_plots_subsection}

Contingency tables using row or column proportions
are especially useful for examining how two categorical
variables are related.
Stacked bar plots provide a way to visualize
the information in these tables.

A \termsub{stacked bar plot}{bar plot!stacked bar plot}
\index{bar plot!segmented bar plot}
is a graphical display of contingency table information.
For example, a~stacked bar plot representing
Figure~\ref{colPropAppTypeHomeownership}
is shown in Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_seg_bar},
where we have first created a bar plot using the
\var{homeownership} variable and then divided each group
by the levels of \mbox{\var{app\us{}type}}.

One related visualization to the stacked bar plot is the
\termsub{side-by-side bar plot}{bar plot!side-by-side},
where an example is shown in
Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_sbs_bar}.

For the last type of bar plot we introduce,
the column proportions for the
\var{app\us{}type} and \var{homeownership} contingency table
have been translated into a standardized stacked bar plot
in Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_seg_bar_standardized}.
This type of visualization is helpful in understanding
the fraction of individual or joint loan applications
for borrowers in each level of \var{homeownership}.
Additionally, since the proportions of \resp{joint}
and \resp{individual} vary across the groups,
we can conclude that the two variables are associated.

This "Rent" bar is also broken into two categories, blue for "individual" and yellow for "joint". The bottom portion of the bar, running up to about 3500, is blue to represent the "joint" applications where the application had a "rent" value for homeownership, and the rest (about vertical height representing about 400) of the bar is yellow to represent the "individual" applications. The second bar is for "Mortgage" at about 4700 total, the bottom 3900 of which are shown as blue for individual applications and the top of which is yellow for "joint" applications and appears to have a height of about 800. The third bar is for "Own" at about 1300, of which about 1100 is for the individual (blue) application type and about 200 of which is joint (yellow) application type.

The first of these two bars is blue for "individual" application type (having a height of about 3500) and the second is yellow for the "joint" application type (having a height of about 400).

This bar plot shows the homeownership variable and its three levels -- from left to right: rent, mortgage, and own -- as their own bars, where each bar runs from the horizontal axis at 0 up to a value of 1. This standardization where all total bars span the same vertical distance allows for an easier comparison of the proportional breakdown of the coloring in each stacked bar. The coloring breakdown of each bar represents the application type: individual (blue) and joint (yellow). For the first bar, rent, the blue runs up to about 0.9 on the vertical, and the yellow portion of the bar runs from 0.9 to 1.0. In the second bar, mortgage, the blue runs from horizontal axis up to about 0.8, and the yellow portion of the bar runs from 0.8 to 1.0. The third bar, own, has its blue portion run from the horizontal axis up to about 0.87, and the yellow portion runs from 0.87 to 1.0.]

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Examine the three bar plots in
    Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_seg_bar_plot}.
    When is the stacked, side-by-side, or standardized
    stacked bar plot the most useful?}
  The stacked bar plot is most useful when it's reasonable
  to assign one variable as the explanatory variable and
  the other variable as the response, since we are effectively
  grouping by one variable first and then breaking it down by
  the others.

  Side-by-side bar plots are more agnostic in their display
  about which variable, if any, represents the explanatory
  and which the response variable.
  It is also easy to discern the number of cases
  in the six different group combinations.
  However, one downside
  is that it tends to require more horizontal space;
  the narrowness of Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_sbs_bar}
  makes the plot feel a bit cramped.
  Additionally, when two groups are of very different sizes,
  as we see in the \resp{own} group relative to either of the
  other two groups,
  it is difficult to discern if there is an association
  between the variables.

  The standardized stacked bar plot is helpful if the primary
  variable in the stacked bar plot is relatively imbalanced,
  e.g. the \resp{own} category has only a third of the
  observations in the \resp{mortgage} category,
  making the simple stacked bar plot less useful for
  checking for an association.
  The major downside of the standardized version
  is that we lose all sense of how many cases each of the
  bars represents.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

%Before settling on a particular bar plot, consider each
%carefully.
%It can also be useful to make a couple of the versions,
%which will offer different views and insights into the data
%than if only one bar plot variant is reviewed.

\subsection{Mosaic plots}
\label{mosaic_plots_subsection}

A \term{mosaic plot} is a visualization technique
suitable for contingency tables that resembles
a standardized stacked bar plot with the benefit
that we still see the relative group sizes of the
primary variable as well.

To get started in creating our first mosaic plot,
we'll break a square into columns for each category
of the \var{homeownership} variable,
with the result shown in Figure~\ref{loan_home_mosaic}.
Each column represents a level of \var{homeownership},
and the column widths correspond to the proportion of
loans in each of those categories.
For~instance, there are fewer loans where the borrower
is an owner than where the borrower has a mortgage.
In general, mosaic plots use box \emph{areas}
to represent the number of cases in each category.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \subfigure[]{
    \Figures[A one-variable mosaic plot is shown for the homeownership variable, which has levels rent, mortgage, and own. A one-variable mosaic plot can first be pictured as a square that has partitions running vertically, breaking that square up into three pieces, one piece per level. The portion of the square assigned to each piece is proportional to the number of cases for each level. In this particular mosaic plot, we see a "rent" piece on the left portion of the square that has been colored green -- this tall rectangle represents about 40\% of the square. Now considering the middle tall rectangle, which is blue and has been labeled as "mortgage", its width is close to half of the total width of the square. The rightmost tall rectangle is red and is labeled "own", and it appears to represent a little more than 10\% of the total width of the rectangle.]
        {0.36}
        {loan_app_type_home_mosaic_plot}
        {loan_home_mosaic}
    \label{loan_home_mosaic}
  }
  \subfigure[]{
    \Figures[A two-variable mosaic plot is shown, partitioned with vertical slices first for the homeownership variable in the same way as a one-variable mosaic plot, and then each of the tall rectangle from that one-variable mosaic plot has been sliced horizontally to represent the application types individual (shown as the upper portion of each tall rectangle) and joint (shown as the lower portion of each tall rectangle). Taking the first tall rectangle on the left of the mosaic plot, which is green and labeled as "rent", it is divided into a small "joint" rectangle at the bottom of the "rent" rectangle and a much larger upper portion that represents the "individual" application types of the rent homeownership cases. This same partitioning is repeated for the tall middle rectangle representing the blue mortgage homeownership cases, where a small portion of those applications are broken off into a smaller rectangle on the bottom for "joint" and a larger rectangle for the cases that are "individual". Similarly, the rightmost tall rectangle that is red and represents "own" has been divided into a lower rectangle for "joint" and an upper portion for "individual" application types. The benefit of this plot is that we can now get a sense of the proportional makeup of each homeownership category by looking at the relative widths of the three different colored tall rectangles, and we can also look at where each of these tall rectangles is broken into joint and individual applications. In this case, the tall rectangle for rent is broken lower than the mortgage and own levels, indicating it has fewer of the "joint" application types (which if you recall, was the lower sub-divided rectangles). The "own" category also has its horizontal break a bit lower than the "mortgage" rectangle's break, implying the mortgage category has the highest proportion of joint applications of the rent, mortgage, and own homeownership categories.]

      plot for \var{homeownership}.
      \subref{loan_app_type_home_mosaic}~Two-variable mosaic
      plot for both \var{homeownership}
      and \var{app\us{}type}.}
  \label{loan_app_type_home_mosaic_plot}
\end{figure}

To create a completed mosaic plot, the single-variable
mosaic plot is further divided into pieces in
Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_mosaic} using the
\var{app\us{}type} variable.
Each column is split proportional to the
number of loans from individual and joint
borrowers.
For example, the second column represents loans
where the borrower has a mortgage,
and it was divided into individual loans (upper)
and joint loans (lower).
As another example, the bottom segment of the third column
represents loans where the borrower owns their home
and applied jointly, while the upper segment
of this column represents
borrowers who are homeowners and filed individually.
We can again use this plot to see that
the \var{homeownership} and \var{app\us{}type}
variables are associated, since some columns are divided
in different vertical locations than others,
which was the same technique used for checking an
association in the standardized stacked bar plot.

In Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_mosaic_plot},
we chose to first split by the homeowner status
of the borrower.
However, we could have instead first split by
the application type, as in
Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_mosaic_rev}.
Like with the bar plots, it's common to use
the explanatory variable to represent the
first split in a mosaic plot,
and then for the response to break
up each level of the explanatory variable,
if these labels are reasonable to attach to
the variables under consideration.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figures[A two-variable mosaic plot that has been first divided vertically using the mortgage application type (individual on the left and joint on the right), and then each of those rectangles subdivided horizontally ("own" in red on the bottom, "mortgage" in blue in the middle, and "rent" in green on the top). The "individual" category as the left main rectangle spans about 85\% of the square, while the right main rectangle for "joint" spans about 15\% of the square. The homeownership breakdown within each of the main rectangles shows "own" represents roughly the same proportion in each, running up about 10\% of the way up from the bottom. The next subdivided portion of each rectangle is "mortgage", and here we see that the left "individual" rectangle has only about 45\% of its rectangle as "mortgage" while it represents about 60\%  in the right "joint" rectangle. The "rent" subdivided portions at the top of each rectangle represents about 40\% of the left "individual" rectangle and about 25\% of the "joint" rectangle.]

  \label{loan_app_type_home_mosaic_rev}
\end{figure}

%In a similar way, a mosaic plot representing row proportions of Figure~\ref{loan_home_app_type_totals} could be constructed, as shown in Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_mosaic_rev}. However, because it is more insightful for this application to consider the fraction of spam in each category of the \var{number} variable, we prefer Figure~\ref{loan_app_type_home_mosaic}.


\subsection{The only pie chart you will see in this book}

A \term{pie chart} is shown in
Figure~\ref{loan_homeownership_pie_chart} alongside
a bar plot representing the same information.
Pie charts can be useful for giving a high-level overview
to show how a set of cases break down.
However, it is also difficult to decipher details
in a pie chart.
For example, it takes a couple seconds longer to recognize
that there are more loans where the borrower has
a mortgage than rent when looking at the pie chart,
while this detail is very obvious in the bar plot.
While pie charts can be useful, we prefer bar plots
for their ease in comparing groups.
%One benefit of pie charts is that they to make it easier
%to see when a series of groups make up at least 50\%,
%e.g. \Comment{would need to show a pie chart with
%  a large number of categories for this point to make sense}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure[There are two plots, each providing a visualization of the homeownership variable. The left plot is a pie chart, which is a circle that has three lines drawn from the center of the circle to its edge, dividing the circle into "slices". The lower left slice is large, representing close to 50\% of the total circle, it is colored blue, and it is labeled "mortgage". The upper slice is also quite large, representing almost 40\% of the circle, is colored green, and it is labeled "rent". The lower right slice is much smaller, representing about 15\% of the circle, it is colored red, and it is labeled "own". Next, moving to the right plot, is shown a bar plot. This bar plot has homeownership categories along the horizontal axis and frequency along the vertical axis. The leftmost bar is green, is labeled "rent", and has a frequency of about 3900. The middle bar is blue, is labeled "mortgage", and has a frequency of about 4700. The rightmost bar is red, is labeled "own", and has a frequency of about 1300.]

\subsection{Comparing numerical data across groups}
\label{comparingAcrossGroups}

\index{data!county|(}

Some of the more interesting investigations can be considered
by examining numerical data across groups.
The methods required here aren't really new:
all that's required is to make a numerical plot for each group
in the same graph.
Here two convenient methods are introduced:
side-by-side box plots and hollow histograms.

We will take a look again at the \data{county} data set
and compare the median household income for counties that
gained population from 2010 to 2017 versus counties that
had no gain.
While we might like to make a causal connection here,
remember that these are observational data and so such
an interpretation would be, at best, half-baked.

\newcommand{\numcountieswithgains}{1454}
\newcommand{\numcountieswithgainsC}{1,454}
\newcommand{\numcountieswithoutgains}{1672}
\newcommand{\numcountieswithoutgainsC}{1,672}

There were \numcountieswithgainsC{} counties where
the population increased from 2010 to 2017, and there
were \numcountieswithoutgainsC{} counties with no gain
(all but one were a loss).
A~random sample of 100 counties from the first group and
50 from the second group are shown in
Figure~\ref{countyIncomeSplitByPopGainTable}
to give a better sense of some of the raw median
income data.

\D{\newpage}

The \term{side-by-side box plot}
\index{box plot!side-by-side box plot}
is a traditional tool for comparing across groups.
An example is shown in the left panel of
Figure~\ref{countyIncomeSplitByPopGain},
where there are two box plots, one for each group,
placed into one plotting window and drawn on the same scale.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

Another useful plotting method uses \termsub{hollow histograms}{hollow histogram} to compare numerical data across groups. These are just the outlines of histograms of each group put on the same plot, as shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{countyIncomeSplitByPopGain}.

\footnotetext{Answers may vary a little.
  The counties with population gains tend to have higher
  income (median of about \$45,000) versus counties without
  a gain (median of about \$40,000).
  The variability is also slightly larger for the population
  gain group.
  This is evident in the IQR, which is about 50\% bigger
  in the \emph{gain} group.
  Both distributions show slight to moderate right skew
  and are unimodal.
  The box plots indicate there are many observations

  anticipate that many observations will fall beyond
  the whiskers when examining any data set that
  contain more than a couple hundred data points.}

\subsection{Variability within data}
\label{variabilityWithinData}

\index{data!malaria vaccine|(}

We consider a study on a new malaria vaccine
called PfSPZ.
In this study, volunteer patients were randomized
into one of two experiment groups:
14 patients received an experimental vaccine
and 6 patients received a placebo vaccine.
Nineteen weeks later, all 20 patients were exposed
to a drug-sensitive malaria parasite strain;
the motivation of using a drug-sensitive strain
of parasite here is for ethical considerations,
allowing any infections to be treated effectively.
The results are summarized in
Figure~\ref{malaria_vaccine_20_exp_summary},
where 9 of the 14 treatment patients remained free
of signs of infection while all of the~6 patients
in the control group patients showed some baseline
signs of infection.

Is this an observational study or an experiment?
What implications does the study type have on what can

\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{The
  study is an experiment, as patients were randomly
  assigned an experiment group.
  Since this is an experiment, the results can be used
  to evaluate a causal relationship between the malaria
  vaccine and whether patients showed signs
  of an infection.}

In this study, a smaller proportion of patients
who received the vaccine showed signs of an infection
(\malariaVIRPerc{} versus \malariaPIRPerc{}).
However, the sample is very small,
and it is unclear whether the difference provides
\emph{convincing evidence} that the vaccine is
effective.

\D{\newpage}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Data scientists are sometimes called
    upon to evaluate the strength of evidence.
    When looking at the rates of infection for patients
    in the two groups in this study,
    what comes to mind as we try to determine whether
    the data show convincing evidence of a real difference?}
  \label{malaria_vaccine_20_what_is_convincing}
  The observed infection rates
  (\malariaVIRPerc{} for the treatment group versus
  \malariaPIRPerc{} for the control group)
  suggest the vaccine may be effective.
  However, we cannot be sure if the observed difference
  represents the vaccine's efficacy or is just from
  random chance.
  Generally there is a little bit of fluctuation
  in sample data, and we wouldn't expect the sample
  proportions to be \emph{exactly} equal,
  even if the truth was that the infection rates
  were independent of getting the vaccine.
  Additionally, with such small samples,
  perhaps it's common to observe such large differences
  when we randomly split a group due to chance alone!
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

Example~\ref{malaria_vaccine_20_what_is_convincing}
is a reminder that the observed outcomes in the data
sample may not perfectly reflect the true relationships
between variables since there is \term{random noise}.
While the observed difference in rates of infection
is large, the sample size for the study is small,
making it unclear if this observed difference represents
efficacy of the vaccine or whether it is simply due to
chance.
We label these two competing claims, $H_0$ and $H_A$,
which are spoken as ``H-nought'' and ``H-A'':
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[$H_0$:] \textbf{Independence model.}
    The variables \var{treatment} and \var{outcome}
    are independent.
    They have no relationship, and the observed difference
    between the proportion of patients who developed
    an infection in the two groups, \malariaIRDiffPerc{},
    was due to chance.
\item[$H_A$:] \textbf{Alternative model.}
    The variables are \emph{not} independent.
    The difference in infection rates of
    \malariaIRDiffPerc{}
    was not due to chance,
    and vaccine affected the rate of infection.
\end{itemize}

What would it mean if the independence model,
which says the vaccine had no influence on the
rate of infection, is true?
It would mean 11~patients were going to
develop an infection \emph{no matter which group
they were randomized into},
and 9~patients would not develop an infection
\emph{no matter which group they were randomized
into}.
That~is, if the vaccine did not affect the rate
of infection, the difference in the infection rates
was due to chance alone in how the patients were
randomized.

Now consider the alternative model:
infection rates were influenced by whether a patient
received the vaccine or not.
If this was true, and especially if this influence
was substantial, we would expect to see some difference
in the infection rates of patients in the groups.

We choose between these two competing claims
by assessing if the data conflict so much with
$H_0$ that the independence model cannot be deemed
reasonable.
If this is the case, and the data support $H_A$,
then we will reject the notion of independence
and conclude the vaccine was effective.


\subsection{Simulating the study}
\label{simulatingTheStudy}

We're going to implement
\termsub{simulations}{simulation},
where we will pretend we know that the malaria
vaccine being tested does \emph{not} work.
Ultimately, we want to understand if the large
difference we observed is common in these
simulations.
If it is common, then maybe the difference
we observed was purely due to chance.
If it is very uncommon, then the possibility
that the vaccine was helpful seems more plausible.

Figure~\ref{malaria_vaccine_20_exp_summary}
shows that 11 patients developed infections and 9 did not.
For our simulation, we will suppose the infections
were independent of the vaccine and we were able to
\emph{rewind} back to when the researchers randomized
the patients in the study.
If we happened to randomize the patients differently,
we may get a different result in this hypothetical
world where the vaccine doesn't influence the infection.
Let's complete another \term{randomization} using
a simulation.

\D{\newpage}

In this \term{simulation}, we take 20 notecards to
represent the 20 patients, where we write down ``infection''
on 11 cards and ``no infection'' on 9 cards.
In this hypothetical world, we believe each patient
that got an infection was going to get it regardless
of which group they were in, so let's see what happens
if we randomly assign the patients to the treatment
and control groups again.
We thoroughly shuffle the notecards and deal 14 into
a \resp{vaccine} pile and 6 into a \resp{placebo} pile.
Finally, we tabulate the results, which are shown in
Figure~\ref{malaria_vaccine_20_exp_summary_rand_1}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l cc rr}
  & & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\var{outcome}} \\
  \cline{3-4}
  &  &  {infection} & {no infection} & Total & \hspace{3mm}  \\ 
  \cline{2-5}
  treatment & {vaccine} & 7 & 7 & 14 \\ 
  (simulated) & {placebo} & 4 & 2 & 6 \\ 
  \cline{2-5}
  & Total & 11 & 9 & 20 \\
  \cline{2-5}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Simulation results, where any difference
    in infection rates is purely due to chance.}

\end{figure}

\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{$4 / 6 - 7 / 14 = 0.167$
  or about 16.7\% in favor of the vaccine.
  This difference due to chance is much smaller than the
  difference observed in the actual groups.}


\subsection{Checking for independence}

We computed one possible difference under the
independence model in Guided
Practice~\ref{malaria_vaccine_20_exp_summary_rand_1_diff},
which represents one difference due to chance.
While in this first simulation, we physically dealt
out notecards to represent the patients,
it is more efficient to perform this simulation
using a computer.
Repeating the simulation on a computer, we get another
difference due to chance:
\begin{align*}
\frac{2}{\malariaBD{}} - \frac{9}{\malariaAD{}} = -0.310
\end{align*}
And another:
\begin{align*}
\frac{3}{\malariaBD{}} - \frac{8}{\malariaAD{}} = -0.071
\end{align*}
And so on until we repeat the simulation enough times
that we have a good idea of what represents the
\emph{distribution of differences from chance alone}.
Figure~\ref{malaria_rand_dot_plot} shows a stacked plot
of the differences found from 100 simulations,
where each dot represents a simulated difference between
the infection rates (control rate minus treatment rate).

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \Figure[A stacked dot plot is shown. The horizontal axis represents "difference in infection rates" and has a range of -0.6 to 0.8. There are six stacks of dots shown in the plot, with 3 points shown at -0.55, 20-25 points shown at -0.32, 30-35 points shown at -0.08, 25-30 points shown at 0.18, 10-12 points shown at 0.41, and 2 points shown at 0.64.]
      {0.85}{malaria_rand_dot_plot}
  \caption{A stacked dot plot of differences from
      100 simulations produced under the independence model,
      $H_0$, where in these simulations infections are
      unaffected by the vaccine.
      Two of the 100 simulations had a difference of
      at least \malariaIRDiffPerc{}, the difference observed
      in the study.}
  \label{malaria_rand_dot_plot}
\end{figure}

Note that the distribution of these simulated differences
is centered around 0.
We simulated these differences assuming that the independence
model was true, and under this condition,
we expect the difference to be near zero with some random
fluctuation, where \emph{near} is pretty generous in this
case since the sample sizes are so small in this study.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{How often would you observe a difference
    of at least \malariaIRDiffPerc{} (\malariaIRDiff{})
    according to Figure~\ref{malaria_rand_dot_plot}?
    Often, sometimes, rarely, or never?}
  It appears that a difference of at least
  \malariaIRDiffPerc{} due to chance alone would only
  happen about 2\% of the time according to
  Figure~\ref{malaria_rand_dot_plot}.
  Such a low probability indicates a rare event.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\D{\newpage}

The difference of \malariaIRDiffPerc{} being
a rare event suggests two possible interpretations
of the results of the study:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
  \item[$H_0$] \textbf{Independence model.}
      The vaccine has no effect on infection rate,
      and we just happened to observe a difference
      that would only occur on a rare occasion.
  \item[$H_A$] \textbf{Alternative model.}
      The vaccine has an effect on infection rate,
      and the difference we observed was actually due to
      the vaccine being effective at combatting malaria,
      which explains the large difference
      of~\malariaIRDiffPerc{}.
\end{itemize}
Based on the simulations, we have two options.
(1)~We conclude that the study results do not provide
strong evidence against the independence model.
That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence
to conclude the vaccine had an effect in this
clinical setting.
(2)~We conclude the evidence is sufficiently strong
to reject $H_0$ and assert that the vaccine was useful.
When we conduct formal studies, usually we reject the
notion that we just happened to observe a rare
event.\footnote{This reasoning does not generally extend
    to anecdotal observations.
    Each of us observes incredibly rare events every day,
    events we could not possibly hope to predict.
    However, in the non-rigorous setting of anecdotal
    evidence, almost anything may appear to be a rare event,
    so the idea of looking for rare events in day-to-day
    activities is treacherous.
    For example, we might look at the lottery:
    there was only a 1 in 292 million chance that the
    Powerball numbers for the largest jackpot in history
    (January 13th, 2016) would be (04, 08, 19, 27, 34)
    with a Powerball of (10),
    but nonetheless those numbers came up!
    However, no matter what numbers had turned up,
    they would have had the same incredibly rare odds.
    That is, \emph{any set of numbers we could have
    observed would ultimately be incredibly rare}.
    This type of situation is typical of our daily lives:
    each possible event in itself seems incredibly rare,
    but if we consider every alternative, those outcomes
    are also incredibly rare.
    We should be cautious not to misinterpret such
    anecdotal evidence.}
So in this case, we reject the independence model in favor
of the alternative.
That is, we are concluding the data provide strong evidence
that the vaccine provides some protection against malaria
in this clinical setting.

\index{data!malaria vaccine|)}

One field of statistics, statistical inference, is built
on evaluating whether such differences are due to chance.
In statistical inference, data scientists evaluate which
model is most reasonable given the data.
Errors do occur, just like rare events, and we might choose
the wrong model.
While we do not always choose correctly, statistical
inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how
often these errors occur.
In Chapter~\ref{foundationsForInference},
we give a formal introduction to the problem of model
selection.
We spend the next two chapters building a foundation
of probability and theory necessary to make that
discussion rigorous.
