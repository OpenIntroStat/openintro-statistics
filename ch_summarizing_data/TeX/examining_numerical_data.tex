\eoce{\qt{Mammal life spans\label{mammal_life_spans}} Data were collected on life spans (in 
years) and gestation lengths (in days) for 62 mammals. A scatterplot of life span versus 
length of gestation is shown below. \footfullcite{Allison+Cicchetti:1975}

\noindent\begin{minipage}[c]{0.44\textwidth}
\begin{parts}
\item What type of an association is apparent between life span and length of gestation?
\item What type of an association would you expect to see if the axes of the plot were reversed, i.e. if we plotted length of gestation versus life span?
\item Are life span and length of gestation independent? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Reproducing bacteria\label{reproducing_bacteria}} Suppose that there is only 
sufficient space and nutrients to support one million bacterial cells in a petri dish. 
You place a few bacterial cells in this petri dish, allow them to reproduce freely, and 
record the number of bacterial cells in the dish over time. Sketch a plot representing 
the relationship between number of bacterial cells and time.

\eoce{\qt{Office productivity\label{office_productivity}} Office productivity is relatively low 
when the employees feel no stress about their work or job security. However, high levels 
of stress can also lead to reduced employee productivity. Sketch a plot to represent the 
relationship between stress and productivity.

\eoce{\qt{Parameters and statistics\label{parameters_stats}} Identify which value represents 
the sample mean and which value represents the claimed population mean.
\begin{parts}
\item American households spent an average of about \$52 in 2007 on Halloween 
merchandise such as costumes, decorations and candy. To see if this number had changed, 
researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry numbers were reported. The 
survey included 1,500 households and found that average Halloween spending was \$58 per 
household.
\item The average GPA of students in 2001 at a private university was 3.37. A survey 
on a sample of 203 students from this university yielded an average GPA of 3.59 
a decade later.

\eoce{\qt{Sleeping in college\label{college_sleeping}} A recent article in a college newspaper 
stated that college students get an average of 5.5 hrs of sleep each night. A student who 
was skeptical about this value decided to conduct a survey by randomly sampling 25 
students. On average, the sampled students slept 6.25 hours per night. Identify which 
value represents the sample mean and which value represents the claimed population mean.

\eoce{\qt{Days off at a mining plant\label{days_off_mining}} Workers at a particular mining 
site receive an average of 35 days paid vacation, which is lower than the national 
average. The manager of this plant is under pressure from a local union to increase the 
amount of paid time off. However, he does not want to give more days off to the workers 
because that would be costly. Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a 
way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees. In 
order to achieve this goal, should he fire employees who have the most number of days 
off, least number of days off, or those who have about the average number of days off?

\eoce{\qt{Air quality\label{air_quality_durham}} Daily air quality is measured by the air 
quality index (AQI) reported by the Environmental Protection Agency. This index reports 
the pollution level and what associated health effects might be a concern. The index is 
calculated for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act and takes values 
from 0 to 300, where a higher value indicates lower air quality. AQI was reported for a 
sample of 91 days in 2011 in Durham, NC. The relative frequency histogram below shows 
the distribution of the AQI values on these days. \footfullcite{data:durhamAQI:2011} \\
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.55\textwidth}
\begin{parts}
\item Estimate the median AQI value of this sample.
\item Would you expect the mean AQI value of this sample to be higher or lower than the 
median? Explain your reasoning.
\item Estimate Q1, Q3, and IQR for the distribution.
\item Would any of the days in this sample be considered to have an unusually low or 
high AQI? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Facebook friends\label{dist_shape_fb_friends}} Facebook data indicate that 
50\% of Facebook users have 100 or more friends, and that the average friend 
count of users is 190. What do these findings suggest about the shape of the 
distribution of number of friends of Facebook users? \footfullcite{Backstrom:2011}
