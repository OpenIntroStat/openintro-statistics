\eoce{\qtq{Which is higher\label{which_higher_scatter}} Determine if I or II 
is higher or if they are equal. Explain your reasoning.
\noindent For a regression line, the uncertainty associated with the 
slope estimate, $b_1$, is higher when
\begin{enumerate}
\item[I.] there is a lot of scatter around the regression line or
\item[II.] there is very little scatter around the regression line
\end{enumerate}

\eoce{\qt{Over-under, Part I\label{residual_apple_weight}} Suppose we fit a 
regression line to predict the shelf life of an apple based on its weight. 
For a particular apple, we predict the shelf life to be 4.6 days. The 
apple's residual is -0.6 days. Did we over or under estimate the 
shelf-life of the apple? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Over-under, Part II\label{residual_sun_cancer}} Suppose we fit a 
regression line to predict the number of incidents of skin cancer per 
1,000 people from the number of sunny days in a year. For a particular 
year, we predict the incidence of skin cancer to be 1.5 per 1,000 people, 
and the residual for this year is 0.5. Did we over or under estimate 
the incidence of skin cancer? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Tourism spending\label{tourism_spending_reg_conds}} The Association of 
Turkish Travel Agencies reports the number of foreign tourists 
visiting Turkey and tourist spending by year.
\footfullcite{data:turkeyTourism} Three plots are provided: 
scatterplot showing the relationship between these two variables 
along with the least squares fit, residuals plot, and histogram of 
residuals.
\begin{center}
\FigureFullPath[A scatterplot with a least squares regression line is fit based on about 50 points. The horizontal axis represents "Number of tourists" and has values ranging from about 0 to about 27 million. The vertical axis represents "Spending, in US dollars", with values ranging from about \$0 to about \$17 billion. There are many points shown with the number of tourists between 0 and 5 million, which has spending between about \$0 and \$3 billion, where even on this small scale a roughly linear trend is evident. The linear trend continues on across the plot and is quite strong -- where residuals generally do not deviate from the least square line by more than very roughly \$1 billion. The data are also more sparse for larger values in the plot. There is one region in the center of the plot where about 10 points in a row lie above the regression line. Also consider the next two plots before answering any questions for this exercise.]{0.32}{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/eoce/tourism_spending_reg_conds/tourism_spending_count}
\FigureFullPath[A residual plot is shown. The horizontal axis represents "Number of tourists" and has values ranging from about 0 to about 27 million. Residuals are shown on the vertical axis and have values ranging from about -\$1.5 billion to about \$1.2 billion. The points on the far left between 0 and 3 million tourists shows a "v" pattern. There are about 15 points with number of tourists between 3 million and 10 million, which shows an slight upward trend from about -\$700 million to \$1.2 billion. There about 10 points with number of tourists greater than 10 million up to about 27 million, and these show a slight downward trend from about \$1 billion to -\$1.5 billion.]{0.32}{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/eoce/tourism_spending_reg_conds/tourism_spending_count_residuals}

\item Describe the relationship between number of tourists and spending.

The scatterplot below shows the relationship between the number of 
calories and amount of carbohydrates (in grams) Starbucks food menu 
items contain.\footfullcite{data:starbucksCals} Since Starbucks only 
lists the number of calories on the display items, we are interested 
in predicting the amount of carbs a menu item has based on its 
calorie content.
\begin{center}
\FigureFullPath[A scatterplot is shown with about 75 points and an overlaid regression line that trends upward. The horizontal axis represents "Calories" and has values ranging from about 100 to 500. The vertical axis represents "Carbs, in grams" and has values ranging from about 20 to 80. About 15 points are shown with fewer than 200 calories, and these have between about 18 and 25 grams of carbs. About 30 points are shown with 200 to 400 calories, and these mostly have between 30 and 60 grams of carbs. About 20 points are shown with more than 400 calories, and these mostly have between 35 and 80 grams of carbs.]{0.32}{ch_regr_simple_linear/figures/eoce/starbucks_cals_carbos/starbucks_cals_carbos}
\FigureFullPath[A residual plot is shown with about 75 points. The horizontal axis represents "Calories" and has values ranging from about 100 to 500.

About 30 points are shown with 200 to 400 calories, and these residuals largely range from about -15 to positive 15.

\eoce{\qt{The Coast Starlight, Part II\label{coast_starlight_reg}}
Exercise~\ref{coast_starlight_corr_units} introduces data on the Coast Starlight 
Amtrak train that runs from Seattle to Los Angeles. The mean travel 
time from one stop to the next on the Coast Starlight is 129 mins, 
with a standard deviation of 113 minutes. The mean distance traveled 
from one stop to the next is 108 miles with a standard deviation of 
99 miles. The correlation between travel time and distance is 0.636.
\begin{parts}
\item Write the equation of the regression line for predicting travel 
time.
\item Interpret the slope and the intercept in this context.
\item Calculate $R^2$ of the regression line for predicting travel 
time from distance traveled for the Coast Starlight, and interpret 
$R^2$ in the context of the application.
\item The distance between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles is 103 
miles. Use the model to estimate the time it takes for the Starlight 
to travel between these two cities.
\item It actually takes the Coast Starlight about 168 mins to travel 
from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. Calculate the residual and explain 
the meaning of this residual value.
\item Suppose Amtrak is considering adding a stop to the Coast 
Starlight 500 miles away from Los Angeles. Would it be appropriate to 
use this linear model to predict the travel time from Los Angeles to 
this point?

mean shoulder girth is 107.20 cm with a standard deviation of

girth of 100 cm. Predict the height of this student using the model.
\item The student from part~(d) is 160 cm tall. Calculate the 
residual, and explain what this residual means.
