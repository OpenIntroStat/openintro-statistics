\eoce{\qt{Visualize the residuals\label{visualize_residuals}} 
The scatterplots shown below each have a 
superimposed regression line. If we were to construct a residual plot 
(residuals versus $x$) for each, describe what those plots would look 
like.

\FigureFullPath[A scatterplot is shown, where the data have a steady upward trend throughout. The observations above and below the line appear random.

Shown below are two plots of residuals

appropriate for these data. Explain your reasoning.

\FigureFullPath[A scatterplot of the residuals is shown. When looking at any horizontal region of the plot, the observations are consistently scattered around the "y equals 0" line.
