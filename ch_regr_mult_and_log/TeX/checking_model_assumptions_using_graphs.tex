\eoce{\qt{Baby weights, Part VI\label{baby_weights_conds}} 
Exercise~\ref{baby_weights_mlr} presents a regression model for predicting the 
average birth weight of babies based on length of gestation, parity, height, 
weight, and smoking status of the mother. Determine if the model assumptions are 
met using the plots below. If not, describe how to proceed with the analysis.

\eoce{\qt{Movie returns, Part I\label{movie_returns_altogether}}
A FiveThirtyEight.com article reports that
``Horror movies get nowhere near as much draw at the box 
office as the big-time summer blockbusters or
action/adventure movies ... but thereâ€™s a huge incentive
for studios to continue pushing them out.
The return-on-investment potential for horror movies
is absurd."
To investigate how the return-on-investment compares
between genres and how this relationship has changed over
time, an introductory statistics student fit a model
predicting the ratio of gross revenue of movies from
genre and release year for 1,070 movies released between
2000 and 2018.
Using the plots given below, determine if this regression
model is appropriate for these
data.\footfullcite{webpage:horrormovies}

\FigureFullPath[A histogram is shown for "Residuals", which take values from about -15 to 100. The shape of the distribution is extremely right-skewed but centered at 0. The bin -15 to -10 represents about 1\% of the values. The bin -10 to -5 represents about 1\% of the values. The bin -5 to 0 represents about 65\% of the values. The bin 0 to 5 represents about 25\% of the values. The bin 5 to 10 represents about 2\% of the values. The bin 10 to 15 represents about 1\% of the values. The remaining bins above 15 have far less than 1\% of the data.]{0.47}{ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/eoce/movie_returns_altogether/horror_movies_conds_hist_res}\hspace{3mm}
\FigureFullPath[A scatterplot is shown. The horizontal axis is for "Fitted Values", which takes values between 2.5 and 12. The vertical axis is for "Residuals" and takes values from -15 to about 90, though only about a dozen values have residuals larger than 25. The points are also colored for different genres: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, and Horror. The points for Action, Adventure, Comedy, and Drama are clustered on the left with Fitted Values between 2.5 and 3.5, and the residuals for these points are largely between -5 and 12. The Horror points have Fitted Values between about 11 and 12, with residuals for these points largely between -10 and 25.]{0.47}{ch_regr_mult_and_log/figures/eoce/movie_returns_altogether/horror_movies_conds_res_genre_fitted}\\[5mm]
\FigureFullPath[A dot plot is shown for "residuals", where points are broken up into different genres: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, and Horror. The residuals for Action, Adventure, Comedy, and Drama groups have residuals for these points largely between -5 and 12.

\FigureFullPath[A scatterplot is shown for "residuals" (vertical axis) against "release year" (horizontal axis) from 2010 to 2018.
