%A foundational principle that supports quality statistical
%analysis is well-organized data.

\index{data|(}

Each data set within the text is described in this appendix,
and there is a corresponding page for each of these data sets at
\oiRedirect{data}
    {\color{black}\textbf{openintro.org/data}}.
This page also includes additional data sets that can be
used for honing your skills.
Each data set has its own page with the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item
    Description of each data set.
\item
    Detailed overview of each data set's variables.
\item
    CSV download.
\item
    R object file download.
\end{itemize}
Over time we will also expand the information available
on these pages.

\item[\ref{pointEstimates}]
    [\datalink{pew\_energy\_2018}]
    The actual data has more observations than were referenced
    in this chapter.
    That is, we used a subsample since it helped smooth some
    of the examples to have a bit more variability.
    The \data{pew\us{}energy\us{}2018} data set represents
    the full data set for each of the different energy source
    questions, which covers solar, wind, offshore drilling,
    hydrolic fracturing, and nuclear energy.

    In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had
    recently been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to
    the hospital with a slight fever and was subsequently
    diagnosed with Ebola.
    Soon thereafter, an NBC~4 New York/The Wall Street
    Journal/Marist Poll found that
    82\% of New Yorkers favored a
    ``mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come
    in contact with an Ebola patient''.
    This poll included responses of 1,042
    New York adults between Oct 26th and~28th, 2014.

    [Rosling questions]

    describe in their book,
    \oiRedirect{amazon_factfulness}{Factfulness},
    The samples we describe are similar but not
    the same as the actual rates.
    The approximate rates for the correct answers for the
    two questions for (sometimes different) populations
    discussed in the book, as reported in
    \oiRedirect{amazon_factfulness}{Factfulness},
    are
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
        80\% of the world's 1 year olds have been vaccinated
        against some disease:
        13\% get this correct (17\% in the US).

        \oiRedirect{gapm-io-q5}{gapm.io/q5}
    \end{itemize}
    Here are a few more questions and a rough percent
    of people who get them correct:
    \begin{itemize}

        What is the life expectancy of the world today:
        50 years, 60 years, or 70 years?
        Answer: 70 years.
        In the US, about 43\% of people get this question correct.

%        About 13\% of people get this question correct.
%        \oiRedirect{gapm-io-q9}{gapm.io/q9}
    \item
        In 1996, tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos
        were all listed as endangered.
        How many of these three species are more
        critically endangered today:
        two of them,
        one of them,
        none of them?
        Answer: none of them.
        About 7\% of people get this question correct.

    \item
        How many people in the world have some access
        to electricity? 20\%, 50\%, 80\%.
        Answer: 80\%.

    The group of 3 imperfect linear plots use groups~1-3

    We did omit discussion of some structure in
    the data for the analysis presented:
    the experiment design included blocking,
    where typically four resumes were sent to each job:
    one for each inferred race/sex combination
    (as inferred based on the first name).
    We did not worry about this blocking aspect,
    since accounting for the blocking would
    \emph{reduce} the standard error without notably
    changing the point estimates for the
    \var{race} and \var{sex} variables
    versus the analysis performed in the section.
    That is, the most interesting conclusions in the
    study would be unaffected even with a more
    sophisticated analysis.
