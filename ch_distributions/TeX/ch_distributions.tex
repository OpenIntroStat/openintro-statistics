\chapterintro{In this chapter,
  we discuss statistical distributions that frequently
  arise in the context of data analysis or statistical
  inference.
  We start with the normal distribution in the first section,
  which is used frequently in later chapters of this book.

\section{Normal distribution}
\label{normalDist}

\index{distribution!normal|(}
\index{normal distribution|(}

Among all the distributions we see in practice,
one is overwhelmingly the most common.
The symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous
throughout statistics.
Indeed it is so common, that people often know it as the
\termsub{normal curve}{normal distribution} or
\term{normal distribution}\index{distribution!normal|textbf}%
,\footnote{It
  is also introduced as the Gaussian distribution after Frederic
  Gauss, the first person to formalize its mathematical
  expression.}
shown in Figure~\ref{simpleNormal}.
Variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males
closely follow the normal distribution.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure[A bell-shaped curve that is symmetric about its center is shown. This is the normal distribution. From the left, the curve starts low, grad lifting off the horizontal axis before more steeply rising, before it starts to rise more slowly and flattens at its peak. From the peak, it starts to decrease slowly and then more steeply, before gradually flattening out as it approaches the horizontal axis. This is the bell-shaped normal distribution, an it is the shape of many distributions we will encounter throughout this book. In general, going forward, this bell-shaped distribution shape should be remembered whenever the normal distribution is discussed.]{0.5}{simpleNormal}
  \caption{A normal curve.}
  \label{simpleNormal}
\end{figure}

\begin{onebox}{Normal distribution facts}
  Many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal.
  Thus the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single
  problem, is very useful for a variety of problems.
  We will use it in data exploration and to solve important
  problems in statistics.
\end{onebox}


\subsection{Normal distribution model}

The \term{normal distribution} always describes a symmetric,
unimodal, bell-shaped curve.
However, these curves can look different depending on the
details of the model.
Specifically, the normal distribution model can be adjusted
using two parameters: mean and standard deviation.
As you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell
curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation
stretches or constricts the curve.
Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormals} shows the normal distribution
with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$ in the left panel
and the normal distributions with mean $19$ and standard
deviation $4$ in the right panel.
Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormalsStacked} shows these distributions
on the same axis.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure[Two normal distributions are shown. The first has a center of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, where the two tails of the normal distribution curve are essentially indistinguishable from a height of 0 for values less than -3 or larger than positive 3. The second normal distribution is centered at 19 and has a standard deviation of 4, where the height of the distribution is indistinguishable from 0 when it is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.]{0.7}{twoSampleNormals}
  \caption{Both curves represent the normal distribution.
      However, they differ in their center and spread.}
  \label{twoSampleNormals}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure[Two normal distributions are shown on the same plot. The first has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The second has a mean of 19 and a standard deviation of 4. One important property visible in the plot is, because distributions are required to have an area of 1, the normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1 appears much narrower and but also much taller than the second distribution that has a standard deviation of 4.]{0.6}{twoSampleNormalsStacked}
  \caption{The normal distributions shown in
      Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormals} but plotted together
      and on the same scale.}
  \label{twoSampleNormalsStacked}
\end{figure}

If a normal distribution has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation
$\sigma$, we may write the distribution as $N(\mu, \sigma)$.
The two distributions in Figure~\ref{twoSampleNormalsStacked}
may be written as
\begin{align*}
N(\mu=0,\sigma=1)
  \quad \text{and} \quad
  N(\mu=19,\sigma=4)
\end{align*}
Because the mean and standard deviation describe a normal
distribution exactly, they are called the distribution's
\termsub{parameters}{parameter}.
The normal distribution with mean $\mu = 0$ and
standard deviation $\sigma = 1$ is called the
\term{standard normal distribution}%
\index{normal distribution!standard|textbf}.

\subsection{Standardizing with Z-scores}

\noindent%
We often want to put data onto a standardized scale,
which can make comparisons more reasonable.

\newcommand{\satmean}{1100}
\newcommand{\satsd}{200}
\newcommand{\actmean}{21}
\newcommand{\actsd}{6}
\newcommand{\annsatscore}{1300}
\newcommand{\annsatzscore}{1}
\newcommand{\tomsatscore}{24}
\newcommand{\tomsatzscore}{0.5}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Table~\vref{satACTstats} shows the mean
    and standard deviation for total scores on the SAT and ACT.
    The distribution of SAT and ACT scores are both nearly normal.
    Suppose Ann scored \annsatscore{} on her SAT and Tom scored
    \tomsatscore{} on his ACT.
    Who performed better?}
  \label{actSAT}%
  We use the standard deviation as a guide.
  Ann is \annsatzscore{} standard deviation above average
  on the SAT: $\satmean{} + \satsd{} = \annsatscore{}$.
  Tom is \tomsatzscore{} standard deviations above the mean
  on the ACT:
  $\actmean{} + \tomsatzscore{} \times \actsd{} = \tomsatscore{}$.
  In Figure~\ref{satActNormals}, we can see that Ann tends
  to do better with respect to everyone else than Tom did,
  so her score was better.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

The SAT distribution has a mean of 1100 and a standard deviation of 200, while the ACT distribution has a mean of 21 and standard deviation of 6. Ann's score is 1300 for the SAT, and Tom's score is 24 for the ACT. Based on their positioning in their respective plots, it is evident that Ann has a higher relative value for her SAT distribution than Tom has for his ACT score.]{0.6}{satActNormals}
  \caption{Ann's and Tom's scores shown against
      the SAT and ACT distributions.}
  \label{satActNormals}
\end{figure}

Example~\ref{actSAT} used a standardization technique called
a Z-score, a method most commonly employed for nearly normal
observations but that may be used with any distribution.
The \term{Z-score}\index{Z@$Z$} of an observation is defined
as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below
the mean.
If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean,
its Z-score is~1.
If it is 1.5 standard deviations \emph{below} the mean,
then its Z-score is -1.5.
If $x$ is an observation from a distribution $N(\mu, \sigma)$,
we define the Z-score mathematically as
\begin{align*}
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\end{align*}
Using $\mu_{SAT} = \satmean{}$, $\sigma_{SAT} = \satsd{}$,
and $x_{_{\text{Ann}}} = \annsatscore{}$, we find Ann's Z-score:
\begin{align*}
Z_{_{\text{Ann}}}
  = \frac{x_{_{\text{Ann}}} - \mu_{_{\text{SAT}}}}
      {\sigma_{_{\text{SAT}}}}
  = \frac{\annsatscore{} - \satmean{}}{\satsd{}}
  = \annsatzscore{}
\end{align*}

\begin{onebox}{The Z-score}
  The Z-score of an observation is the number of standard
  deviations it falls above or below the mean.
  We compute the Z-score for an observation $x$ that follows
  a distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation
  $\sigma$ using
  \begin{align*}
  Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
  \end{align*}
\end{onebox}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Use Tom's ACT score, \tomsatscore{}, along with the ACT mean and
standard deviation to find his Z-score.\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{$Z_{Tom}
  = \frac{x_{\text{Tom}} - \mu_{\text{ACT}}}
      {\sigma_{\text{ACT}}}
  = \frac{\tomsatscore{} - \actmean{}}{\actsd{}}
  = \tomsatzscore{}$}

Observations above the mean always have positive Z-scores,
while those below the mean always have negative Z-scores.
If an observation is equal to the mean,
such as an SAT score of \satmean{}, then the Z-score is $0$.

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}

\footnotetext{(a) Its Z-score is given by
    $Z
      = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
      = \frac{5.19 - 3}{2}
      = 2.19/2
      = 1.095$.
    (b)~The observation $x$ is 1.095 standard deviations
    \emph{above} the mean.
    We know it must be above the mean since $Z$ is positive.}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise} \label{headLZScore}
Head lengths of brushtail possums follow a normal
distribution with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm.
Compute the Z-scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm
and 85.8~mm.\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{For $x_1=95.4$ mm:
    $Z_1
      = \frac{x_1 - \mu}{\sigma}
      = \frac{95.4 - 92.6}{3.6}
      = 0.78$.
    For $x_2=85.8$ mm:
    $Z_2 = \frac{85.8 - 92.6}{3.6} = -1.89$.}

We can use Z-scores to roughly identify which observations
are more unusual than others.
An observation $x_1$ is said to be more unusual than another
observation $x_2$ if the absolute value of its Z-score is larger
than the absolute value of the other observation's Z-score:
$|Z_1| > |Z_2|$.
This technique is especially insightful when a distribution
is symmetric.

\footnotetext{Because the \emph{absolute value} of Z-score
  for the second observation is larger than that of the first,
  the second observation has a more unusual head length.}


\subsection{Finding tail areas}

It's very useful in statistics to be able to identify tail areas
of distributions.
For instance, what fraction of people have an SAT score below
Ann's score of 1300?
This is the same as the \term{percentile} Ann is at, which is
the percentage of cases that have lower scores than Ann.
We can visualize such a tail area like the curve and shading
shown in Figure~\ref{satBelow1300}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure[A normal distribution is shown with a mean of 1100 and a standard deviation of 200. The distribution is shaded to the left of the value 1300, meaning the area bound by the horizontal axis, the bell-shaped curve (up to the horizontal value of 1300) and a vertical line at 1300 is shaded.]{0.45}{satBelow1300}
  \caption{The area to the left of $Z$ represents the
      fraction of people who scored lower than Ann.}
  \label{satBelow1300}
\end{figure}

There are many techniques for doing this, and we'll discuss
three of the options.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
    The most common approach in practice is to use
    statistical software.
    For example, in the program \R{}, we could find the area
    shown in Figure~\ref{satBelow1300} using the
    following command, which takes in the Z-score
    and returns the lower tail area: \\
    {\color{white}.....}%
        \texttt{> pnorm(1)} \\
    {\color{white}.....}%
        \texttt{[1] 0.8413447} \\
    According to this calculation,
    the region shaded that is below 1300
    represents the proportion 0.841 (84.1\%) of SAT test
    takers who had Z-scores below $Z = 1$.
    More generally, we can also specify the cutoff explicitly
    if we also note the mean and standard deviation: \\
    {\color{white}.....}%
        \texttt{> pnorm(1300, mean = 1100, sd = 200)} \\
    {\color{white}.....}%
        \texttt{[1] 0.8413447} %\\
    %\Add{More examples for using \R{} are provided
    %  at the end of the section.}


    There are many other software options, such as Python or SAS;
    even spreadsheet programs such as
    Excel and Google Sheets support these calculations.
\item
    A common strategy in classrooms is to use a graphing
    calculator, such as a TI or Casio calculator.
    These calculators require a series of button presses
    that are less concisely described.
    You can find instructions on using these calculators
    for finding tail areas of a normal distribution in the
    OpenIntro video library:
    \begin{center}
    \oiRedirect{textbook-openintro_videos}
        {www.openintro.org/videos}
    \end{center}
\item
    The last option for finding tail areas is to use
    what's called a \term{probability table};
    these are occasionally used in classrooms
    but rarely in practice.
    Appendix~\ref{normalProbabilityTable}
    contains such a table and a guide for how to use it.
\end{enumerate}
We will solve normal distribution problems in this section
by always first finding the Z-score.
The reason is that we will encounter close parallels
called \indexthis{test statistics}{test statistic}
beginning in Chapter~\ref{ch_foundations_for_inf};
these are, in many instances, an equivalent of a Z-score.

\subsection{Normal probability examples}
\label{normal_probability_examples}

\noindent%
Cumulative SAT scores are approximated well by a normal model,
$N(\mu = \satmean{}, \sigma = \satsd{})$.

\newcommand{\shannonsat}{1190}
\newcommand{\shannonsatz}{0.45}
\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker,
    and nothing is known about Shannon's SAT aptitude.
    What is the probability Shannon scores at least
    \shannonsat{} on her SATs?}
  \label{satAbove1190Exam}%
  First, always draw and label a picture of the normal
  distribution.
  (Drawings need not be exact to be useful.)
  We are interested in the chance she scores above
  \shannonsat{}, so we shade this upper tail:
  \begin{center}
  \Figure[A normal distribution with a mean of 1100 and standard deviation of 200 has the area below the distribution shaded for horizontal values larger than 1300.]{0.4}{satAbove1190}
  \end{center}
  The picture shows the mean and the values at
  2~standard deviations above and below the mean.
  The simplest way to find the shaded area under
  the curve makes use of the Z-score of the cutoff value.
  With $\mu = \satmean{}$, $\sigma = \satsd{}$,
  and the cutoff value $x = \shannonsat{}$,
  the Z-score is computed as
  \begin{align*}
  Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
    = \frac{\shannonsat{} - \satmean{}}{\satsd{}}
    = \frac{90}{\satsd{}}
    = \shannonsatz{}
  \end{align*}
  Using statistical software (or another preferred method),
  we can find the area left of $Z = \shannonsatz{}$ as 0.6736.
  %This is Shannon's \term{percentile},
  %which is the fraction of folks who scored below her score
  %of \shannonsat{}.
  To find the area \emph{above} $Z = \shannonsatz{}$,
  we compute one minus the area of the lower tail:
  \begin{center}
  \Figure[A full shaded normal distribution is shown, then a "minus" sign, then a normal distribution with most of its region shaded up to a little above the mean, then an equals sign, and then a normal distribution with an area in the upper tail shaded. Above those images is the text "1.0000 minus 0.6736 equals 0.3264". This visualization is intended to show how we can think of finding an upper tail of the normal distribution as taking the entire area below the distribution (which has a value of 1) and subtracting a portion of the area to the left to get an area to the right.]{0.4}{subtractingArea}
  \end{center}
  The probability Shannon scores at least 1190 on the SAT
  is 0.3264.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{onebox}{Always draw a picture first,
    and find the Z-score second}
  For any normal probability situation,
  \emph{always always always} draw and label the
  normal curve and shade the area of interest first.
  The picture will provide an estimate of the probability.
  After drawing a figure to represent the situation,
  identify the Z-score for the value of interest.
\end{onebox}

\begin{exercisewrap}

\D{\newpage}

\newcommand{\edwardsat}{1030}
\newcommand{\edwardsatz}{-0.35}
\newcommand{\edwardsatlower}{0.3632}
\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Edward earned a \edwardsat{} on his SAT.
    What is his percentile?}
  \label{edwardSatBelow\edwardsat{}}%
  First, a picture is needed.
  Edward's \hiddenterm{percentile} is the proportion of people
  who do not get as high as a \edwardsat{}.
  These are the scores to the left of \edwardsat{}.
\begin{center}

\end{center}
Identifying the mean $\mu=\satmean{}$, the standard
deviation $\sigma=\satsd{}$, and the cutoff for the tail
area $x=\edwardsat{}$ makes it easy to compute the Z-score:
\begin{align*}
Z
  = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
  = \frac{\edwardsat{} - \satmean{}}{\satsd{}}
  = \edwardsatz{}
\end{align*}
Using statistical software, we get a tail area of 0.3632.
Edward is at the $36^{th}$ percentile.

\D{\newpage}

The last several problems have focused on finding the
percentile (lower tail) or the upper tail for a particular observation.
What if you would like to know the observation corresponding
to a particular percentile?

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Erik's height is at the $40^{th}$ percentile.
    How tall is he?}\label{normalExam40Perc}
  As always, first draw the picture.\vspace{-4mm}
  \begin{center}
  \Figure{0.3}{height40Perc}\vspace{-1mm}
  \end{center}
  In this case, the lower tail probability is known (0.40),
  which can be shaded on the diagram.
  We want to find the observation that corresponds to this value.
  As a first step in this direction, we determine the Z-score
  associated with the $40^{th}$ percentile.
  Using software, we can obtain the corresponding Z-score
  of about -0.25.

  Knowing $Z_{Erik} = -0.25$ and the population parameters
  $\mu = 70$ and $\sigma = 3.3$ inches, the Z-score formula can be
  set up to determine Erik's unknown height, labeled
  $x_{_{\text{Erik}}}$:
  \begin{align*}
  -0.25
    = Z_{_{\text{Erik}}}
    = \frac{x_{_{\text{Erik}}} - \mu}{\sigma}
    = \frac{x_{_{\text{Erik}}} - 70}{3.3}
  \end{align*}
  Solving for $x_{_{\text{Erik}}}$ yields a height of 69.18 inches.
  That is, Erik is about 5'9''.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{What is the adult male height at the
    $82^{nd}$ percentile?}
  Again, we draw the figure first.\vspace{-3mm}
  \begin{center}
  \Figure[A normal distribution with mean 70 and standard deviation 3.3 is shaded from the left up to a vertical line a bit above the distribution mean. The shaded area to the left of the vertical line is labeled as "82\% (0.82)" and the upper, unshaded tail is labeled "18\% (0.18)".]{0.28}{height82Perc}\vspace{-1mm}
  \end{center}
  Next, we want to find the Z-score at the $82^{nd}$ percentile,
  which will be a positive value and can be found using software
  as $Z = 0.92$.
  Finally, the height $x$ is found using the Z-score formula
  with the known mean $\mu$, standard deviation $\sigma$,
  and Z-score $Z = 0.92$:
  \begin{align*}
  0.92 = Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{x - 70}{3.3}
  \end{align*}
  This yields 73.04 inches or about 6'1'' as the height
  at the $82^{nd}$ percentile.

\subsection{68-95-99.7 rule}

Here, we present a useful rule of thumb for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution. This will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z-table.

\begin{figure}[hht]
\centering
\Figure[A normal distribution is shown. The central region, from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above the mean, is shaded blue and is labeled with a value of 68\%. The region further out to two standard deviations below the mean to two standard deviations above the mean is shaded green (besides the portion shaded blue) and is labeled with a value of 95\%. The region further out to three standard deviations below the mean to three standard deviations above the mean is shaded yellow (besides the portions shaded green or blue) and is labeled with a value of 99.7\%. Those percentages -- 68\%, 95\%, and 99.7\% -- represent the portions of the area below a normal distribution within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean.]{0.63}{6895997}
\caption{Probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.}
\label{6895997}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Use software, a calculator, or a probability table
to confirm that about 68\%, 95\%, and 99.7\%
of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3, standard deviations
of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively.
For instance, first find the area that falls between $Z=-1$
and $Z=1$, which should have an area of about 0.68.
Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between
$Z=-2$ and $Z=2$.\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{First draw the pictures.
  Using software, we get 0.6827 within 1~standard deviation,
  0.9545 within 2~standard deviations,
  and 0.9973 within 3~standard deviations.}

It is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4,~5,
or~even more standard deviations from the mean.
However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are
nearly normal.
The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations
from the mean is about 1-in-15,000.
For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-2 million
and 1-in-500 million, respectively.

%\section{Evaluating the normal approximation}
%\label{assessingNormal}
%
%Many processes can be well approximated by the normal distribution.
%We have already seen two good examples:
%SAT scores and the heights of US adult males.
%While using a normal model can be extremely convenient
%and helpful, it is important to remember normality is
%always an approximation.
%Evaluating the appropriateness of the normal assumption
%is a key step in many data analyses.
%
%\index{normal probability plot|(}
%
%Example~\ref{normalExam40Perc} in Section~\ref{normalDist}
%suggested the distribution of heights of US males is well
%approximated by the normal model.
%We are interested in proceeding under the assumption that
%the data are normally distributed, but first we must check
%to see if this is reasonable.
%
%There are two visual methods for checking the assumption of
%normality, which can be implemented and interpreted quickly.
%The first is a simple histogram with the best fitting normal
%curve overlaid on the plot, as shown in the left panel of
%Figure~\ref{fcidMHeights}.
%The sample mean $\bar{x}$ and standard deviation $s$ are used
%as the parameters of the best fitting normal curve.
%The closer this curve fits the histogram, the more reasonable
%the normal model assumption.
%Another common method is examining a
%\term{normal probability plot},\footnote{Also commonly
%  called a \term{quantile-quantile plot}.}
%shown in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fcidMHeights}.
%The closer the points are to a perfect straight line,
%the more confident we can be that the data follow the
%normal model.

%    These will provide a benchmark for what to look for
%    in plots of real data.}
%  \label{normalExamplesExample}%
%  The left panels show the histogram (top) and normal
%  probability plot (bottom) for the simulated data set
%  with 40 observations.
%  The data set is too small to really see clear structure
%  in the histogram.
%  The normal probability plot also reflects this,
%  where there are some deviations from the line.
%  We should expect deviations of this amount for
%  such a small data set.
%
%  The middle panels show diagnostic plots for the
%  data set with 100 simulated observations.
%  The histogram shows more normality and the normal
%  probability plot shows a better fit.
%  While there are a few observations that deviate
%  noticeably from the line, they are not particularly
%  extreme.
%
%  The data set with 400 observations has a histogram
%  that greatly resembles the normal distribution,
%  while the normal probability plot is nearly a perfect
%  straight line.
%  Again in the normal probability plot there is one
%  observation (the largest) that deviates slightly from
%  the line.
%  If that observation had deviated 3 times further from
%  the line, it would be of greater importance in a real
%  data set.
%  Apparent outliers can occur in normally distributed
%  data but they are rare.
%
%  Notice the histograms look more normal as the sample
%  size increases, and the normal probability plot becomes
%  straighter and more stable.

\section{Geometric distribution}
\label{geomDist}

How long should we expect to flip a coin until it turns up \resp{heads}? Or how many times should we expect to roll a die until we get a \resp{1}? These questions can be answered using the geometric distribution. We first formalize each trial -- such as a single coin flip or die toss -- using the Bernoulli distribution, and then we combine these with our tools from probability (Chapter~\ref{probability}) to construct the geometric distribution.

Many health insurance plans in the United States have
a deductible, where the insured individual is responsible
for costs up to the deductible, and then the costs above
the deductible are shared between the individual and
insurance company for the remainder of the year.

Suppose a health insurance company found that \insureSperc{} of the
people they insure stay below their deductible in any given year.
Each of these people can be thought of as a \term{trial}.
We label a person a \term{success} if her healthcare costs
do not exceed the deductible.
We label a person a \term{failure} if she does exceed her
deductible in the year.
Because 70\% of the individuals will not hit their deductible,
we denote the \term{probability of a success} as
$p = \insureSprob{}$.
The probability of a failure is sometimes denoted with
$q = 1 - p$, which would be \insureFprob{} for the insurance
example.

When an individual trial only has two possible outcomes, often
labeled as \resp{success} or \resp{failure}, it is called a
\termsub{Bernoulli random variable}{distribution!Bernoulli}.
We chose to label a person who does not hit her deductible
as a ``success'' and all others as ``failures''.
However, we could just as easily have reversed these labels.
The mathematical framework we will build does not depend
on which outcome is labeled a success and which a failure,
as long as we are consistent.

Bernoulli random variables are often denoted as \resp{1}
for a success and \resp{0} for a failure.
In addition to being convenient in entering data,
it is also mathematically handy.
Suppose we observe ten trials:
\begin{center}
\resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{0} \resp{1} \resp{0} \resp{0} \resp{1} \resp{1} \resp{0}
\end{center}
Then the \term{sample proportion}, $\hat{p}$, is the
sample mean of these observations:
\begin{align*}
\hat{p} = \frac{\text{\# of successes}}{\text{\# of trials}}
    = \frac{1+1+1+0+1+0+0+1+1+0}{10} = 0.6
\end{align*}%
This mathematical inquiry of Bernoulli random variables can
be extended even further.
%\Comment{Maybe the next footnote should instead be an EOCE?}
Because \resp{0} and \resp{1} are numerical outcomes,
we can define the {mean} and {standard deviation}
of a Bernoulli random variable.
(See Exercises~\ref{bernoulli_mean_derivation}
and~\ref{bernoulli_sd_derivation}.)

\begin{onebox}{Bernoulli random variable}
%  A Bernoulli random variable has exactly two possible
%  outcomes, often labeled \resp{1} for the ``success''
%  outcome and \resp{0} for the ``failure'' outcome.\vspace{3mm}
  If $X$ is a random variable that takes value 1 with
  probability of success $p$ and 0 with probability $1-p$,
  then $X$ is a Bernoulli random variable with mean
  and standard deviation
  \begin{align*}
  \mu &= p
      &\sigma&= \sqrt{p(1-p)}
  \end{align*}
\end{onebox}

In general, it is useful to think about a Bernoulli random variable as a random process with only two outcomes: a success or failure. Then we build our mathematical framework using the numerical labels \resp{1} and \resp{0} for successes and failures, respectively.

\D{\newpage}

\subsection{Geometric distribution}

\index{distribution!geometric|(}

The \termsub{geometric distribution}{distribution!geometric}
is used to describe how
many trials it takes to observe a success.
Let's first look at an example.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Suppose we are working at the insurance
    company and need to find a case where the person did
    not exceed her (or his) deductible as a case study.
    If the probability a person will not exceed her
    deductible is \insureSprob{} and we are drawing people
    at random, what are the chances that the first person
    will not have exceeded her deductible, i.e. be a success?
    The second person?
    The third?
    What about we pull $n - 1$ cases before we find
    the first success, i.e. the first success is the
    $n^{th}$ person?
    (If the first success is the fifth person, then we say $n=5$.)}
  \label{waitForDeductible}%
  The probability of stopping after the first person is just
  the chance the first person will not hit her (or his)
  deductible:~\insureSprob{}.
  The probability the second person is the first to hit
  her deductible is
  \begin{align*}
  &P(\text{second person is the first to not hit deductible}) \\
  &\quad
    = P(\text{the first will, the second won't})
    = (\insureFprob{})(\insureSprob{})
    = \insureDistB{}
  \end{align*}
  Likewise, the probability it will be the third case is
  $(\insureFprob{})(\insureFprob{})(\insureSprob{})
    = \insureDistC$.

  If the first success is on the $n^{th}$ person,
  then there are $n-1$ failures and finally 1 success,
  which corresponds to the probability
  $(\insureFprob{})^{n-1}(\insureSprob{})$.
  This is the same as
  $(1-\insureSprob{})^{n-1}(\insureSprob{})$.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

Example~\ref{waitForDeductible} illustrates what the
\termsub{geometric distribution}{distribution!geometric},
which describes the waiting
time until a success for
\term{independent and identically distributed (iid)}
Bernoulli random variables.
In this case, the \emph{independence} aspect just means
the individuals in the example don't affect each other,
and \emph{identical} means they each have the same probability
of success.

The geometric distribution from Example~\ref{waitForDeductible} is shown in Figure~\ref{geometricDist70}. In general, the probabilities for a geometric distribution decrease \term{exponentially} fast.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure[The probability distribution of "Number of Trials Until a Success for p = 0.7" is shown, which appears as a bar plot. The possible values shown are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The probabilities for these are about 0.7, 0.21, 0.07, 0.02, 0.01, and then the values are nearly indistinguishable for the values of 6, 7, and 8.]{0.8}{geometricDist70}
  \caption{The geometric distribution when the probability
      of success is $p = \insureSprob{}$.}
  \label{geometricDist70}
\end{figure}

While this text will not derive the formulas for the mean (expected) number of trials needed to find the first success or the standard deviation or variance of this distribution, we present general formulas for each.

\begin{onebox}{Geometric Distribution}
  \index{distribution!geometric|textbf}%
  If the probability of a success in one trial is $p$
  and the probability of a failure is $1-p$, then the
  probability of finding the first success in the
  $n^{th}$ trial is given by\vspace{-1.5mm}
  \begin{align*}
  (1-p)^{n-1}p
  \end{align*}
  The mean (i.e. expected value), variance,
  and standard deviation of this wait time are given by
  \begin{align*}
  \mu &= \frac{1}{p}
      &\sigma^2 &=\frac{1-p}{p^2}
      &\sigma &= \sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p^2}}
  \end{align*}
\end{onebox}

It is no accident that we use the symbol $\mu$ for both the mean and expected value. The mean and the expected value are one and the same.

It takes, on average, $1/p$ trials to get a success under the geometric distribution. This mathematical result is consistent with what we would expect intuitively. If the probability of a success is high (e.g. 0.8), then we don't usually wait very long for a success: $1/0.8 = 1.25$ trials on average. If the probability of a success is low (e.g. 0.1), then we would expect to view many trials before we see a success: $1/0.1 = 10$ trials.

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
The probability that a particular case would not exceed their
deductible is said to be \insureSprob{}.
If we were to examine cases until we found one that where
the person did not hit her deductible, how many cases should
we expect to check?\footnotemark{}
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{What is the chance that we would find
    the first success within the first 3 cases?}
  \label{insureFirstSuccessInLT4}%
  This is the chance it is the first ($n=1$), second ($n=2$),
  or third ($n=3$) case is the first success, which are three
  disjoint outcomes.
  Because the individuals in the sample are randomly sampled
  from a large population, they are independent.
  We compute the probability of each case and add the separate
  results:
  \begin{align*}
  &P(n=1, 2, \text{ or }3) \\
    & \quad = P(n=1)+P(n=2)+P(n=3) \\
    & \quad = (\insureFprob{})^{1-1}(\insureSprob{})

        + (\insureFprob{})^{3-1}(\insureSprob{}) \\
    & \quad = \insureCDistC{}
  \end{align*}
  There is a probability of \insureCDistC{} that we would
  find a successful case within 3 cases.

This is different from the geometric distribution,

\noindent%
Let's again imagine ourselves back at the insurance agency
where \insureSperc{} of individuals do not exceed their
deductible.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Suppose the insurance agency is considering
    a random sample of four individuals they insure.
    What is the chance exactly one of them will exceed
    the deductible and the other three will not?
    Let's call the four people
    Ariana ($A$),
    Brittany ($B$),
    Carlton ($C$),
    and Damian ($D$)
    for convenience.}
  \label{insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible}%
  Let's consider a scenario where one person exceeds
  the deductible:
  \begin{align*}
  &P(A=\text{\insureF{}},
      \text{ }B=\text{\insureS{}},
      \text{ }C=\text{\insureS{}},
      \text{ }D=\text{\insureS{}}) \\
    &\quad = P(A=\text{\insureF{}})\ 
        P(B=\text{\insureS{}})\ 
        P(C=\text{\insureS{}})\ 
        P(D=\text{\insureS{}}) \\
    &\quad =  (\insureFprob{})
        (\insureSprob{})
        (\insureSprob{})
        (\insureSprob{}) \\
    &\quad = (\insureSprob{})^3 (\insureFprob{})^1 \\
    &\quad = \insureBinomCinDSingleScenario{}
  \end{align*}
  But there are three other scenarios: Brittany, Carlton,
  or Damian could have been the one to exceed the deductible.
  In each of these cases, the probability is again
  $(\insureSprob{})^3 (\insureFprob{})^1$.
  These four scenarios exhaust all the possible ways that
  exactly one of these four people could have exceeded
  the deductible, so the total probability is
  $4 \times (\insureSprob{})^3 (\insureFprob{})^1
      = \insureBinomCinD{}$.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}

      \text{ }D=\text{\insureS{}})
    = (\insureSprob{})(\insureFprob{})
        (\insureSprob{})(\insureSprob{})
    = (\insureSprob{})^3 (\insureFprob{})^1$.}


The scenario outlined in Example~\ref{insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible} is an
example of a binomial distribution scenario.
The \termsub{binomial distribution}{distribution!binomial}
describes the probability of having exactly $k$ successes
in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with probability
of a success $p$
(in Example~\ref{insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible},
$n=4$, $k=3$, $p=\insureSprob{}$).
We would like to determine the probabilities associated
with the binomial distribution more generally,
i.e. we want a formula where we can use $n$, $k$, and $p$
to obtain the probability.
To do this, we reexamine each part of
Example~\ref{insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible}.

There were four individuals who could have been the one
to exceed the deductible, and each of these four scenarios
had the same probability.
Thus, we could identify the final probability as
\begin{align*}
[\text{\# of scenarios}] \times P(\text{single scenario})
\end{align*}
The first component of this equation is the number of ways
to arrange the $k=3$ successes among the $n=4$ trials.
The second component is the probability of any of the four
(equally probable) scenarios.

\D{\newpage}

Consider $P($single scenario$)$ under the general case of
$k$ successes and $n-k$ failures in the $n$ trials.
In any such scenario, we apply the Multiplication Rule
for independent events:
\begin{align*}
p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}
\end{align*}
This is our general formula for $P($single scenario$)$.

Secondly, we introduce a general formula for the number
of ways to choose $k$ successes in $n$ trials,
i.e. arrange $k$ successes and $n - k$ failures:
\begin{align*}
{n\choose k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n - k)!}
\end{align*}
The quantity ${n\choose k}$ is read
\term{n choose k}.\footnote{Other notation for
  $n$ choose $k$ includes $_nC_k$, $C_n^k$, and $C(n,k)$.}
The exclamation point notation (e.g. $k!$) denotes
a \term{factorial} expression.\label{factorial_defined}
\begin{align*}
& 0! = 1 \\
& 1! = 1 \\
& 2! = 2\times1 = 2 \\
& 3! = 3\times2\times1 = 6 \\
& 4! = 4\times3\times2\times1 = 24 \\
& \vdots \\
& n! = n\times(n-1)\times...\times3\times2\times1
\end{align*}
Using the formula, we can compute the number of ways
to choose $k = 3$ successes in $n = 4$ trials:
\begin{align*}
{4 \choose 3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!}
  = \frac{4!}{3!1!} 
  = \frac{4\times3\times2\times1}{(3\times2\times1) (1)}
  = 4
\end{align*}
This result is exactly what we found by carefully thinking
of each possible scenario in
Example~\ref{insureOneOfFourExceedsDeductible}.

Substituting $n$ choose $k$ for the number of scenarios
and $p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ for the single scenario probability
yields the general binomial formula.

\begin{onebox}{Binomial distribution}
  Suppose the probability of a single trial being
  a success is $p$.
  Then the probability of observing exactly $k$ successes
  in $n$ independent trials is given by\vspace{-1mm}
  \begin{align*}
  {n\choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
  \end{align*}
  The mean, variance, and standard deviation
  of the number of observed successes are\vspace{-2mm}
  \begin{align*}
  \mu &= np
  &\sigma^2 &= np(1-p)
  &\sigma&= \sqrt{np(1-p)}
  \end{align*}
\end{onebox}

\begin{onebox}{Is it binomial? Four conditions to check.}
  \label{isItBinomialTipBox}%
  (1) The trials are independent. \\
  (2) The number of trials, $n$, is fixed. \\
  (3) Each trial outcome can be classified as a \emph{success}
      or \emph{failure}. \\
  (4) The probability of a success, $p$, is the same for
      each trial.
\end{onebox}

\D{\newpage}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{What is the probability that 3 of 8 randomly
    selected individuals will have exceeded the insurance
    deductible, i.e. that 5 of 8 will not exceed the deductible?
    Recall that 70\% of individuals will not exceed the
    deductible.}
  We would like to apply the binomial model,
  so we check the conditions.
  The number of trials is fixed ($n = 8$) (condition 2)
  and each trial outcome can be classified as a success
  or failure (condition 3).
  Because the sample is random, the trials are independent
  (condition~1) and the probability of a success is the same
  for each trial (condition~4).

  In the outcome of interest, there are $k = 5$ successes
  in $n = 8$ trials (recall that a success is an individual
  who does \emph{not} exceed the deductible), and the
  probability of a success is $p = \insureSprob{}$.
  So the probability that 5 of 8 will not exceed the
  deductible and 3 will exceed the deductible is given by
  \begin{align*}
  { 8 \choose 5}(\insureSprob{})^5
  (1-\insureSprob{})^{8-5}
    &= \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!}
        (\insureSprob{})^5(1-\insureSprob{})^{8-5} \\
    &= \frac{8!}{5!3!}
        (\insureSprob{})^5(\insureFprob{})^3
  \end{align*}
  Dealing with the factorial part:
  \begin{align*}
  \frac{8!}{5!3!}
    = \frac{8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1}
        {(5\times4\times3\times2\times1)(3\times2\times1)}
    = \frac{8\times7\times6}{3\times2\times1}
    = 56
  \end{align*}
  Using $(\insureSprob{})^5(\insureFprob{})^3
    \approx \insureBinomEinHSingleScenario{}$,
  the final probability is about
  $56 \times \insureBinomEinHSingleScenario{}
    \approx \insureBinomEinH{}$.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{onebox}{Computing binomial probabilities}
  The first step in using the binomial model is to check
  that the model is appropriate.
  The second step is to identify $n$, $p$, and $k$.
  As the last stage use software or the formulas
  to determine the probability, then interpret the results.%
  \vspace{3mm}

  If you must do calculations by hand, it's often useful
  to cancel out as many terms as possible in the top and
  bottom of the binomial coefficient.

\footnotetext{We are asked to determine the expected number

  and $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}
    = \sqrt{40\times \insureSprob{}\times \insureFprob{}}
    = \insureBinomFourtySD{}$.
  Because very roughly 95\% of observations fall within
  2~standard deviations of the mean

  at least \insureBinomFourtyLower{}

\subsection{Normal approximation to the binomial distribution}
\label{normalApproxBinomialDistSubsection}

\index{distribution!binomial!normal approximation|(}

The binomial formula is cumbersome when the sample size ($n$) is large, particularly when we consider a range of observations. In some cases we may use the normal distribution as an easier and faster way to estimate binomial probabilities.

\begin{nexample}{Approximately \smokeperc{} of the
    US population smokes cigarettes.
    A local government believed their community had
    a lower smoker rate and commissioned a survey of
    400 randomly selected individuals.
    The survey found that only \smokex{} of the
    \smoken{} participants smoke cigarettes.
    If the true proportion of smokers in the community
    was really \smokeperc{}, what is the probability
    of observing \smokex{} or fewer smokers in a sample
    of \smoken{} people?}
  \label{exactBinomSmokerExSetup}%
  We leave the usual verification that the four conditions
  for the binomial model are valid as an exercise.

  The question posed is equivalent to asking,
  what is the probability of observing
  $k=0$, 1, 2, ..., or \smokex{} smokers in a sample of
  $n = \smoken{}$ when $p=\smokeprop{}$?
  We can compute these \smokexplusone{} different
  probabilities and add them together to find the answer:
  \begin{align*}
  &P(k=0\text{ or }k=1\text{ or }\cdots\text{ or } k=\smokex{}) \\
	&\qquad = P(k=0) + P(k=1) + \cdots + P(k=\smokex{}) \\
	&\qquad = \smokelowertailbinom{}
  \end{align*}
  If the true proportion of smokers in the community
  is $p=\smokeprop{}$, then the probability of observing
  \smokex{} or fewer smokers in a sample of $n=\smoken{}$
  is \smokelowertailbinom{}.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

The computations in Example~\ref{exactBinomSmokerExSetup}
are tedious and long.
In general, we should avoid such work if an alternative method
exists that is faster, easier, and still accurate.
Recall that calculating probabilities of a range of values
is much easier in the normal model.
We might wonder, is it reasonable to use the normal model
in place of the binomial distribution?
Surprisingly, yes, if certain conditions are met.

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Here we consider the binomial model when the probability
of a success is $p = 0.10$.
Figure~\ref{fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal}
shows four hollow histograms for simulated samples from
the binomial distribution using four different sample sizes:
$n = 10, 30, 100, 300$.
What happens to the shape of the distributions as the sample
size increases?
What distribution does the last hollow histogram
resemble?\footnotemark{}

\footnotetext{The distribution is transformed from a blocky

  normal distribution in last hollow histogram.}

The third plot for n = 100 shows a distribution centered at about 10 and that is almost entirely symmetric with just the slightest indication it is right skewed. This third distribution also looks very bell-shaped. The fourth plot for n = 300 shows a distribution centered at about 30 and that is symmetric. This last plot looks very bell-shaped and resembles a normal distribution.]{0.92}{fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal}

  \label{fourBinomialModelsShowingApproxToNormal}
\end{figure}

\begin{onebox}{Normal approximation of the binomial distribution}
  The binomial distribution with probability of success
  $p$ is nearly normal when the sample size $n$ is
  sufficiently large that $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are both
  at least 10.
  The approximate normal distribution has parameters
  corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of
  the binomial distribution:\vspace{-1.5mm}
  \begin{align*}
  \mu &= np
      &\sigma& = \sqrt{np(1 - p)}
  \end{align*}
\end{onebox}

The normal approximation may be used when computing
the range of many possible successes.
For instance, we may apply the normal distribution to
the setting of Example~\ref{exactBinomSmokerExSetup}.

\D{\newpage}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{How can we use the normal approximation
    to estimate the probability of observing \smokex{} or
    fewer smokers in a sample of \smoken{}, if the true

  Showing that the binomial model is reasonable was a
  suggested exercise in Example~\ref{exactBinomSmokerExSetup}.
  We also verify that both $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are at least 10:
  \begin{align*}
  np &= \smoken{} \times \smokeprop{} = \smokemean{}
  &n (1 - p) &= \smoken{} \times \smokepropcomp{}
      = \smokemeancomp{}

  With these conditions checked, we may use the normal
  approximation in place of the binomial distribution
  using the mean and standard deviation from the binomial
  model:
  \begin{align*}
  \mu &= np = \smokemean{}
  &\sigma &= \sqrt{np(1 - p)} = \smokesd{}

\subsection{The normal approximation breaks down on small intervals}

The normal approximation to the binomial distribution tends to perform poorly when estimating the probability of a small range of counts, even when the conditions are met.

\newcommand{\smokeA}{49}
\newcommand{\smokeB}{50}
\newcommand{\smokeC}{51}
\newcommand{\smokeABCBinom}{0.0649}
\newcommand{\smokeABCNormal}{0.0421}
\newcommand{\smokeABCNormalFixed}{0.0633}

Suppose we wanted to compute the probability of observing
\smokeA{}, \smokeB{}, or \smokeC{} smokers in \smoken{}
when $p = \smokeprop{}$.
With such a large sample, we might be tempted to apply
the normal approximation and use the range \smokeA{} to \smokeC{}.
However, we would find that the binomial solution and the normal
approximation notably differ:
\begin{align*}
\text{Binomial:}&\ \smokeABCBinom{}
&\text{Normal:}&\ \smokeABCNormal{}
\end{align*}
We can identify the cause of this discrepancy using
Figure~\ref{normApproxToBinomFail}, which shows the areas
representing the binomial probability (outlined) and normal
approximation (shaded).
Notice that the width of the area under the normal
distribution is 0.5 units too slim on both sides of
the interval.

  \Figure[A normal distribution centered at 60 with a standard deviation of about 7 is shown. (The determination that the standard deviation is about 7 was based on the normal distribution being very close to 0 a distance of about 20 from the mean, and this happens about 3 standard deviations from the mean.) A region of this distribution is shaded from 49 to 51. Additionally, a red outlined area is boxed out between 48.5 and 51.5 that represents the exact binomial distribution.]{1.0}{normApproxToBinomFail}

\begin{onebox}{Improving the normal approximation
    for the binomial distribution}
  The normal approximation to the binomial distribution
  for intervals of values is usually improved if cutoff
  values are modified slightly.
  The cutoff values for the lower end of a shaded region
  should be reduced by 0.5, and the cutoff value for the
  upper end should be increased by 0.5.
\end{onebox}

The tip to add extra area when applying the normal
approximation is most often useful when examining
a range of observations.
In the example above, the revised normal distribution
estimate is \smokeABCNormalFixed{}, much closer to the
exact value of \smokeABCBinom{}.
While it is possible to also apply this correction when
computing a tail area, the benefit of the modification
usually disappears since the total interval is typically
quite wide.

\section{Negative binomial distribution}
\label{negativeBinomial}

\index{distribution!negative binomial|(}

The geometric distribution describes the probability of observing the first success on the $n^{th}$ trial. The \termsub{negative binomial distribution}{distribution!negative binomial} is more general: it describes the probability of observing the $k^{th}$ success on the $n^{th}$ trial.

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Each day a high school football coach tells his star kicker, Brian, that he can go home after he successfully kicks four 35 yard field goals. Suppose we say each kick has a probability $p$ of being successful. If $p$ is small -- e.g. close to 0.1 -- would we expect Brian to need many attempts before he successfully kicks his fourth field goal?}
We are waiting for the fourth success ($k=4$). If the probability of a success ($p$) is small, then the number of attempts ($n$) will probably be large. This means that Brian is more likely to need many attempts before he gets $k=4$ successes. To put this another way, the probability of $n$ being small is low.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

To identify a negative binomial case, we check 4 conditions. The first three are common to the binomial distribution.

\begin{onebox}{Is it negative binomial? Four conditions to check}
(1) The trials are independent. \\
(2) Each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure. \\
(3) The probability of a success ($p$) is the same for each trial. \\
(4) The last trial must be a success.
\end{onebox}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Suppose Brian is very diligent in his attempts and he makes each 35 yard field goal with probability $p=0.8$. Take a guess at how many attempts he would need before making his fourth kick.\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{One possible answer: since he is likely to make each field goal attempt, it will take him at least 4 attempts but probably not more than 6 or 7.}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{In yesterday's practice, it took Brian only 6 tries to get his fourth field goal. Write out each of the possible sequence of kicks.} \label{eachSeqOfSixTriesToGetFourSuccesses}
Because it took Brian six tries to get the fourth success, we know the last kick must have been a success. That leaves three successful kicks and two unsuccessful kicks (we label these as failures) that make up the first five attempts. There are ten possible sequences of these first five kicks, which are shown in Figure~\ref{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals}. If Brian achieved his fourth success ($k=4$) on his sixth attempt ($n=6$), then his order of successes and failures must be one of these ten possible sequences.
\end{nexample}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise} \label{probOfEachSeqOfSixTriesToGetFourSuccesses}
Each sequence in Figure~\ref{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals} has exactly two failures and four successes with the last attempt always being a success. If the probability of a success is $p=0.8$, find the probability of the first sequence.\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{The first sequence:
  $0.2 \times 0.2 \times 0.8 \times
      0.8 \times 0.8 \times 0.8
    = 0.0164$.}

\D{\newpage}

If the probability Brian kicks a 35 yard field goal is $p=0.8$, what is the probability it takes Brian exactly six tries to get his fourth successful kick? We can write this as
{\small\begin{align*}
&P(\text{it takes Brian six tries to make four field goals}) \\
& \quad = P(\text{Brian makes three of his first five field goals, and he makes the sixth one}) \\
& \quad = P(\text{$1^{st}$ sequence OR $2^{nd}$ sequence OR ... OR $10^{th}$ sequence})
\end{align*}
}where the sequences are from Figure~\ref{successFailureOrdersForBriansFieldGoals}. We can break down this last probability into the sum of ten disjoint possibilities:
{\small\begin{align*}
&P(\text{$1^{st}$ sequence OR $2^{nd}$ sequence OR ... OR $10^{th}$ sequence}) \\
&\quad = P(\text{$1^{st}$ sequence}) + P(\text{$2^{nd}$ sequence}) + \cdots + P(\text{$10^{th}$ sequence})
\end{align*}
}The probability of the first sequence was identified in Guided Practice~\ref{probOfEachSeqOfSixTriesToGetFourSuccesses} as 0.0164, and each of the other sequences have the same probability. Since each of the ten sequence has the same probability, the total probability is ten times that of any individual sequence.

The way to compute this negative binomial probability is similar to how the binomial problems were solved in Section~\ref{binomialModel}. The probability is broken into two pieces:
\begin{align*}
&P(\text{it takes Brian six tries to make four field goals}) \\
&= [\text{Number of possible sequences}] \times P(\text{Single sequence})
\end{align*}
Each part is examined separately, then we multiply to get the final result.

We first identify the probability of a single sequence. One particular case is to first observe all the failures ($n-k$ of them) followed by the $k$ successes:
\begin{align*}
&P(\text{Single sequence}) \\
&= P(\text{$n-k$ failures and then $k$ successes}) \\
&= (1-p)^{n-k} p^{k}
\end{align*}

\D{\newpage}

We must also identify the number of sequences for the general case. Above, ten sequences were identified where the fourth success came on the sixth attempt. These sequences were identified by fixing the last observation as a success and looking for all the ways to arrange the other observations. In other words, how many ways could we arrange $k-1$ successes in $n-1$ trials? This can be found using the $n$ choose $k$ coefficient but for $n-1$ and $k-1$ instead:
\begin{align*}
{n-1 \choose k-1} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)! \left((n-1) - (k-1)\right)!} = \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)! \left(n - k\right)!}
\end{align*}
This is the number of different ways we can order $k-1$ successes and $n-k$ failures in $n-1$ trials. If the factorial notation (the exclamation point) is unfamiliar, see page~\pageref{factorial_defined}.

\begin{onebox}{Negative binomial distribution}
  The negative binomial distribution describes the
  probability of observing the $k^{th}$ success on
  the $n^{th}$ trial, where all trials are independent:
  \begin{align*}
  P(\text{the $k^{th}$ success on the $n^{th}$ trial})
      = {n-1 \choose k-1} p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}
  \end{align*}
  The value $p$ represents the probability that
  an individual trial is a success.
\end{onebox}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{Show using the formula for the negative binomial distribution that the probability Brian kicks his fourth successful field goal on the sixth attempt is 0.164.}
The probability of a single success is $p=0.8$, the number of successes is $k=4$, and the number of necessary attempts under this scenario is $n=6$.
\begin{align*}
{n-1 \choose k-1}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\ 
	=\ \frac{5!}{3!2!} (0.8)^4 (0.2)^2\ 
	=\ 10\times 0.0164\ 
	=\ 0.164
\end{align*}
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
The negative binomial distribution requires that each kick attempt by Brian is independent. Do you think it is reasonable to suggest that each of Brian's kick attempts are independent?\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{Answers may vary. We cannot conclusively say they are or are not independent. However, many statistical reviews of athletic performance suggests such attempts are very nearly independent.}

\begin{exercisewrap}
\begin{nexercise}
Assume Brian's kick attempts are independent. What is the probability that Brian will kick his fourth field goal within 5 attempts?\footnotemark
\end{nexercise}
\end{exercisewrap}
\footnotetext{If his fourth field goal ($k=4$) is within five attempts, it either took him four or five tries ($n=4$ or $n=5$). We have $p=0.8$ from earlier. Use the negative binomial distribution to compute the probability of $n = 4$ tries and $n=5$ tries, then add those probabilities together:
\begin{align*}
& P(n=4\text{ OR }n=5) = P(n=4) + P(n=5) \\
&\quad = {4-1 \choose 4-1} 0.8^4 + {5-1 \choose 4-1} (0.8)^4(1-0.8) = 1\times 0.41 + 4\times 0.082 = 0.41 + 0.33 = 0.74
\end{align*}}

\D{\newpage}

\begin{onebox}{Binomial versus negative binomial}
  In the binomial case, we typically have a fixed number
  of trials and instead consider the number of successes.
  In the negative binomial case, we examine how many trials
  it takes to observe a fixed number of successes and
  require that the last observation be a success.

(b) The last ``success'' (admitting a heart attack patient) is fixed to the last day, so we should apply the negative binomial distribution. The parameters are $k=2$, $n=4$: 0.132. (c) This problem is negative binomial with $k=1$ and $n=5$: 0.006. Note that the negative binomial case when $k=1$ is the same as using the geometric distribution.}

\begin{examplewrap}
\begin{nexample}{There are about 8 million individuals
    in New York City.
    How many individuals might we expect to be hospitalized
    for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), i.e. a heart attack,
    each day?
    According to historical records, the average number is
    about 4.4 individuals.
    However, we would also like to know the approximate
    distribution of counts.
    What would a histogram of the number of AMI occurrences
    each day look like if we recorded the daily counts over
    an entire year?}
  \label{amiIncidencesEachDayOver1YearInNYCExample}%
  A histogram of the number of occurrences of AMI on 365 days
  for NYC is shown in
  Figure~\ref{amiIncidencesOver100Days}.\footnotemark{}
  The sample mean (4.38) is similar to the historical average
  of~4.4.
  The sample standard deviation is about 2, and the histogram
  indicates that about 70\% of the data fall between 2.4 and~6.4.
  The distribution's shape is unimodal and skewed to the right.
\end{nexample}
\end{examplewrap}
\footnotetext{These data are simulated. In practice, we should check for an association between successive days.}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \Figure[A histogram is shown for "AMI Events (by Day)". There are 11 non-zero values shown: a frequency of about 15 at a value of 1, a frequency of 50 at 2, 70 at 3, 85 at 4, 55 at 5, 45 at 6, 25 at 7, 20 at 8, 5 at 9, 5 at 10, and a frequency of about 2 at 11.]{0.6}{amiIncidencesOver100Days}
  \caption{A histogram of the number of occurrences
      of AMI on 365 separate days in NYC.}
  \label{amiIncidencesOver100Days}
\end{figure}

The \termsub{Poisson distribution}{distribution!Poisson} is often useful for estimating the number of events in a large population over a unit of time. For instance, consider each of the following events:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item having a heart attack,
\item getting married, and
\item getting struck by lightning.
\end{itemize}
The Poisson distribution helps us describe the number of such events that will occur in a day for a fixed population if the individuals within the population are independent. The Poisson distribution could also be used over another unit of time, such as an hour or a~week.

The histogram in Figure~\ref{amiIncidencesOver100Days} approximates a Poisson distribution with rate equal to 4.4. The \term{rate} for a Poisson distribution is the average number of occurrences in a mostly-fixed population per unit of time. In Example~\ref{amiIncidencesEachDayOver1YearInNYCExample}, the time unit is a day, the population is all New York City residents, and the historical rate is 4.4. The parameter in the Poisson distribution is the rate -- or how many events we expect to observe -- and it is typically denoted by $\lambda$\index{Greek!lambda@lambda ($\lambda$)}
(the Greek letter \emph{lambda})  or $\mu$. Using the rate, we can describe the probability of observing exactly $k$ events in a single unit of time.

\D{\newpage}

\begin{onebox}{Poisson distribution}
  Suppose we are watching for events and the number
  of observed events follows a Poisson distribution
  with rate $\lambda$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
  P(\text{observe $k$ events})
      = \frac{\lambda^{k} e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
  \end{align*}
  where $k$ may take a value 0, 1, 2, and so on,
  and $k!$ represents $k$-factorial, as described on
  page~\pageref{factorial_defined}.
  The letter $e\approx2.718$ is the base of the natural
  logarithm.
  The mean and standard deviation of this distribution
  are $\lambda$ and $\sqrt{\lambda}$, respectively.
\end{onebox}

We will leave a rigorous set of conditions for the Poisson distribution to a later course. However, we offer a few simple guidelines that can be used for an initial evaluation of whether the Poisson model would be appropriate.

A random variable may follow a Poisson distribution if we are looking for the number of events, the population that generates such events is large, and the events occur independently of each other.

Even when events are not really independent --
for instance, Saturdays and Sundays are especially
popular for weddings --
a Poisson model may sometimes still be reasonable
if we allow it to have a different rate for different
times.
In the wedding example, the rate would be modeled as
higher on weekends than on weekdays.
The idea of modeling rates for a Poisson distribution
against a second variable such as the day of week forms
the foundation of some more advanced methods that fall
in the realm of \termsub{generalized linear models}
    {generalized linear model}.
In Chapters~\ref{linRegrForTwoVar}
and~\ref{multipleAndLogisticRegression},
we will discuss a foundation of linear models.
