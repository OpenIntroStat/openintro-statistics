gallon (MPG) from 14 users who drive a 2012 Toyota Prius. The sample mean

Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled the blood 
of 52 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of automobile exhaust 
fumes while working traffic enforcement in a primarily urban environment. The 
blood samples of these officers had an average lead concentration of 
124.32 $\mu$g/l  and a SD of 37.74 $\mu$g/l; a previous study of individuals 
from a nearby suburb, with no history of exposure, found an average blood 
level concentration of 35 $\mu$g/l.\footfullcite{Mortada:2000}

police officers appear to have been exposed to a higher concentration of lead.

exposure than the group in the previous study. Interpret your results in context.

\eoce{\qt{Global warming, Part I\label{global_warming_1}} Is there strong evidence

have changed in the US from 1968 to 2008. The daily high temperature reading on 
January 1 was collected in 1968 and 2008 for 51 randomly selected locations in the 
continental US. Then the difference between the two readings (temperature in 
2008 - temperature in 1968) was calculated for each of the 51 different locations. 
The average of these 51 values was 1.1 degrees with a standard deviation of 4.9 
degrees. We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong 
evidence of temperature warming in the continental US.

\eoce{\qt{Diamonds, Part I\label{diamonds_1}} Prices of diamonds are determined by what is 
known as the 4 Cs: cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. The prices of diamonds go up as the 
carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth. For example, the difference between the 
size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but 
the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond. In 
this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat, each sample of 
size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds. In order to be able to compare 
equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats. 
That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99. For a 1 carat diamond, we divide 
the price by 100. The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below.

The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant

This score measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control, and it is 
part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory (MMPI) test. The experiment had three treatment groups: 
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]

professional help is available.
\item Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute ``emotionally neutral'' tape on 
training hunting dogs.
\item Four hours of  sensory restriction but no taped message. 
\end{enumerate}
Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to these treatment groups, and an MMPI test was 
administered before and after the treatment. Distributions of the differences between pre and 
post treatment scores (pre - post) are shown below, along with some sample statistics. Use this 
information to independently test the effectiveness of each treatment. Make sure to clearly

\item we can then conclude that all the means are different from one another.
\item the standardized variability between groups is higher than the standardized variability
