\eoce{\qt{Chicken diet and weight, Part III\label{chick_wts_anova}} In Exercises~\ref{chick_wts_linseed_horsebean} and \ref{chick_wts_casein_soybean} we compared the effects of two types of feed at a time. A better analysis would first consider all feed types at once: casein, horsebean, linseed, meat meal, soybean, and sunflower. The ANOVA output below can be used to test for differences between the average weights of chicks on different diets.

compared five different methods for teaching descriptive statistics. The five 
methods were traditional lecture and discussion, programmed textbook 
instruction, programmed text with lectures, computer instruction, and computer

method. After completing the course, students took a 1-hour exam.

\item What are the hypotheses for evaluating if the average test scores are 
different for the different teaching methods?

\eoce{\qt{Coffee, depression, and physical activity\label{coffee_depression_phys_act}} 
Caffeine is the world's most widely used stimulant, with approximately 80\% consumed 
in the form of coffee. Participants in a study investigating the relationship between 
coffee consumption and exercise were asked to report the number of hours they spent per 
week on moderate (e.g., brisk walking) and vigorous (e.g., strenuous sports and jogging) 
exercise. Based on these data the researchers estimated the total hours of metabolic 
equivalent tasks (MET) per week, a value always greater than 0. The table below gives 
summary statistics of MET for women in this study based on the amount of coffee consumed.
